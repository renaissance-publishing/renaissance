title: "Motivations and Milestones"
---

The rules of the game are primarily concerned with what your character
can *do:* their abilities, their senses, their skills, and so on. But
perhaps more important to a dedicated role-player are the things that
*make their character who they are:* the motivations that drive them
forward, and the life and history that has shaped them. This section is
concerned with their *motivations* and their *milestones.*

## Motivations

A character’s *motivations* describe the goals that drive them.
Motivations have very little mechanical role—that is, very few rules
refer to them. Instead, they are role-playing guides; they help players
qualify who their characters are, and why (and they help GMs decide if a
player is representing their character well).

Ideally, motivations should be grand and abstract. They do not represent
a character’s immediate aims, or even what they hope to achieve this
year; instead, they represent in the most abstract sense the character’s
view of the world, and what they hope to achieve in their lives.

Motivations are represented by short phrases, preceded with a + or a –
to indicate whether the character is *for* or *against* a given
motivation. Motivations are normally selected during character creation;
but, since they have little “mechanical” importance, they can be
selected later, and they can be changed after the character selects
them.

\+Wealth, +Honor, +Justice and -Slavery are all good motivations. Wealth
and Fame are tangible but limitless; you can gain and loose wealth and
honor, but you can never have so much of either that you can’t have
more. Similarly, the task of ensuring *justice* is never-ending; justice
will always be threatened, and it will always need guardians. Finally,
in principle, you could extinguish slavery everywhere, but it would be
extraordinarily difficult; doing so would practically require
overthrowing not one but several hostile kingdoms.

\-Shaded Sea Peoples or +The Commonwealth are also good motivations;
nation and people are causes larger than an individual, and none has
ever achieved total victory over all its foes (and the final defeat of a
great nation is a momentous-enough event to completely change a
citizen’s view of the world and their place in it).

### Role-Playing Rewards

Motivations are first-and-foremost a guide for the role-player; they
have only two major mechanical roles. First, they can be used to decide
when your character has earned a *rez bonus* (or penalty), and second to
determine (some) situations when a Stress Test may be called for (see
*Character Advancement* and *Injury and Healing*, respectively).

## Milestones

During play, characters will perform great deeds—heroic or infamous,
earning renown or infamy (players, of course, may also throw themselves
into a role, creating a moving moment—or just ham it up, getting a laugh
out of the table). Whenever a scene becomes legendary, a character might
earn a *milestone*.

Milestones are short phrases that describe a significant moment in a
character’s history; they might take the form of a title (like “Scarred
Warrior”) or a description of the event (like “The Great Dive”), but any
short, memorable phrase will do. Characters can have any number of
milestones—they can start without a single one, and they can have as
many as they can earn.

Milestones serve several purposes; one of the simplest and most
important is to provide a short, vivid history of your character. This
is particularly useful in a long-running game, when characters might
have dozens or hundreds of game-sessions worth of history to try to keep
track of; it is also very useful if you are introducing an existing
character to a new group, or to a new player.

Milestones also serve important mechanical roles, by tracking a
character’s reputation, and by allowing a player to tap into their past
triumphs (and failures) for heroic resolve. And they serve an
administrative function too, by allowing GMs to reward players for
producing memorable scenes (either because they were heroic, or moving,
or just hilarious).

### Earning Milestones

Milestones are awarded at the GM’s discretion. Milestone are usually
awarded either to denote either a major achievement (or major failure)
on a character’s part, or to reward a character for good role-playing.

<aside class="example">
Example: Chandra the Drake has ventured into the neighboring Kingdoms of
Men to defeat a slave ring. When he encounters one of their champions—a
Wolverine shifter—rather than frighten, he decides to charge her, using
his *Dragonshire Style* power to grip his sword by the blade and strike
her with the pommel. He rolls a critical success, and inflicts so much
damage that he downs the slaver in that single blow. The (frustrated) GM
decides that Chandra has earned the “Pommel-er” milestone.
</aside>

<aside class="example">
Example: Fire-Watcher the Shifter mage has used his *Journey* power to
teleport himself into the office of Grana (the local Commonwealth
general, who has given the party their current quest) without any
warning, and has then immediately jumped into an explanation of what the
party has learned without providing her with any context. When the GM
points out how odd this is, rather than start again, the player decides
to go with it; he knows that the GM is (also) a fan of Stargate
Atlantis, and so he delivers the remainder of the scene doing his best
Rodney McKay impression. The GM is sufficiently amused that she decides
that Fire-Watcher has earned the “Just Don’t Give Him a Lemon”
milestone.
</aside>

Milestones should not be given too often; they are used to highlight
truly memorable moments in a character’s history, which don’t happen all
the time. We find that most players will earn a milestone *roughly* once
every six games—although this will vary widely. Circumstances that
result in a character earning a milestone often also result in earning
one (or more) additional Rez point(s) as well, and possibly traits (see
*Advancing Characters*).

If you are thinking about awarding a milestone, consider whether the
event you’re commemorating is likely to be important in the future. Will
it play an important role in how the character defines themselves going
forward? Is it a part of the character’s history that will likely come
up in the future? Equally, is it the kind of story that the player is
going to tell the first time they describe their character to someone?
If so, awarding a milestone is appropriate.

<aside class="gmguidance">
Sidebar: Negative Milestones.

Sometimes a player frustrates the group or fails to perform at a
reasonable level; if milestones can be awarded for both great successes
and great failures, and if creating a moving or funny scene can result
in being awarded a milestone, is it also appropriate to punish poor play
with a negative milestone?

Put simply, no. We *strongly* recommend that you don’t record
role-playing failures and player misconduct with milestones. It is
almost always a better idea to talk to a problem player about what
they’re doing than to passive-aggressively give their character a
snide nickname they didn’t pick and hope they take the hint.

<aside class="gmguidance">
Sidebar: Upgrading, Changing and Removing Milestones

Sometimes, character’s (or player’s) current exploits build on their
previous ones; if Aryn has made a fool of the Champions of the One yet
again, does she need to have another milestone to commemorate the
experience? If Lohrs’ scars are healed, is he still the Scarred Warrior?
Sometimes, instead of adding a new milestone, you’d like to upgrade,
change or remove an existing one.

Remember that a character’s milestones are a simplified representation
of their history—of the memorable events that have made them who they
are. If you alter those milestones, you are to some extent altering that
character’s history—something their player may not much appreciate. We
recommend that you *always* ask a player’s permission before upgrading,
changing or removing one of their milestones.

Milestone represents a character’s *history*, not necessarily their
present state. Even if Lohrs’ scars are healed, he can still be the
Scarred Warrior, because he still won a heroic wrestling match with a
Leaper while covered in Scour.
</aside>

### Invoking Milestones

Once per session, a player can *invoke* one of their milestones. (That
is, you only get one “invocation” per game session, no matter how many
milestones you have.) The milestone that the player invokes must have
some kind of *resonance* with their current situation; it might be that
they recall their previous triumphs to spur them on, or it might be that
they have desperate need to redeem themselves after previous failures.

When you invoke a milestone, you may gain any one benefit that you could
spend a point of Luck to gain; alternatively, at their discretion, the
GM may offer you special bonuses or effects appropriate to your
character and the situation.

<aside class="example">
Example: Aryn the Elven archer had previously earned the “Enemy of the
Chosen” milestone for throwing several weapons consecrated to the One
that Chose Us into the ocean as a deliberate offense to the loathsome
spirit. In the current game, she finds herself fighting several of the
One’s champions. When she hits one with a bow, she invokes her milestone
to upgrade her exceptional success into a critical one, as though she
had spent a Luck Point to do so.
</aside>

<aside class="example">
Example: Lohrs the ash-elf grappler had previously earned the “Scarred
Warrior” milestone for grappling a Leaper even as he was covered in
Scour himself. In the current game, Lohrs is attempting to grapple an
opponent that drains away his life as long as he is in contact with it.
The creature scores massive damage, and would disable Lohrs; the GM
offers to allow him to invoke his Scarred Warrior milestone to show
heroic perseverance, allowing him to take one more turn regardless of
how much damage he takes.
</aside>

### Challenging Milestones

Besides a player *invoking* a milestone, the GM can also *challenge* a milestone. To issue a *milestone challenge*, the GM offers a player an additional *challenge* relating to one of their milestones, and a *bonus* should they accept the challenge; the player must then choose to accept the challenge or not. In general, challenges and bonuses should be interesting and appropriate to the milestone; in want of an appropriate challenge or bonus, GMs may use a Luck Point, either for an NPC’s use or the player’s, respectively.

<aside class="example">
Example: Aryn is traveling in one of the larger cities of the Heartland
Province, and the GM decides that it might be and interesting time for
her past to catch up to her. He offers her a challenge: there happens to
be in that city on that day a noble from the Kingdoms of Men who is a
devotee of the One who Chose Us, and who knows of her history. If Aryn
accepts, that noble will notice her, and she will have him to deal with
as a potential enemy—a powerful one, with wealth and a noble title. In
exchange, Aryn will gain a +10 bonus to social skills tests with the
people of the city, owing to her history as a champion of the
Commonwealth and its values.
</aside>

### Social Bonuses and Penalties

Sometimes, a character’s reputation might help them; other times, their
past failures may come back to haunt them. People who know about a
character’s reputation, and who have a reason to either admire or resent
them for it, may treat characters differently.

Sometimes a character will receive a bonus or penalty to their
social-skills tests, based on how the character they are interacting
with views their history; the exact penalty depends on the specific
character they are interacting with. (A reasonable starting-point is a
+20 bonus for a positive view, and a -20 bonus for a negative one.)

Of course, for such a penalty to apply, the character in question
usually has to *know about* a particular character’s history, which
often requires them to have some idea of who the character is; a devotee
of the One can hardly hold Aryn’s history against her if he doesn’t know
who she is.

### Milestones in Character Creation

Since milestones are a part of how your character represents their
history, and since even a fresh character has some prior life and
history, it is possible to choose milestones for your characters during
character creation; see *Character Creation.*

As a special rule, if you are introducing an existing character into a
new game, you may ask the GM to keep some of that character’s existing
milestones. How many milestones the GM allows you to keep—and whether
they require you to pay an CP cost for them—is entirely at their
discretion. (Your willingness to regale the group with the heroic tale
of how you earned those milestones may factor into the GM’s decision, as
might your willingness to buy the group a pizza.)

<aside class="example">
Example: a player joining a new group decides to base her character on
the one she player in her previous game—Venn the Shambler Halberdier.
Even though she builds Ven from scratch using the character creation
rules, she still wants to “keep” some of her favorite moments from Ven’s
previous adventures in her prior game. She asks the GM if she can have
the “Gift of Remorse” and “Ice-Breaker Halberdier” milestones to
represent Venn’s previous exploits.
</aside>

Note that we interpret the idea of an “existing character” somewhat
loosely; your current character need only be inspired by or based on a
previous character—possibly even one from an entirely different game
system—to gain milestones from their history.

<aside class="example">
Example: a player joining a new group decides to base his *Renaissance*
character on his own character from a previous Eclipse Phase game—thus,
Dayton Lex, the lightning-wielding psion. He tells his new group of
Dayton’s exploits vaporizing Ultimates with plasma fire, and of the
hilarious compulsions his old group picked for his async character when
he resleeved. The GM is suitably amused, and grants the new Dayton Lex
the *Ultimate* and *Asynchronous* milestones.
