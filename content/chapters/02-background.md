## The Known World

The Commonwealth and its neighbors are located on the Emerald and Ruby Planes.
The Emerald Plane is a large island continent, about 860 *demarc* across \[about 2236 miles, or 3612km\].
A great mountain range, the Worldspine Mountains, runs up the middle of it; this range is wide, but its peaks are low, and only its central peaks are above the snowline.
In the east, there is a large inland sea, the glass sea; the Kingdoms of Men are on the northern peninsula, while the Goblin Empire is on the south.
In the southwest, near the coast, there is a smaller range, the Seaward Peaks; running along the southern edge, stretching between the Seaward Peaks and the Worldspine Mountain, there is warm, high steppeland; the Ash Elves, members of the Shaded Sea People, hold (most of) these steppes.

Stretching from the western edge of the Glass Sea, over the Worldspine, running north along the Shade Elves territory, reaching all the way to the western edge, and jumping to the Haven Isles beyond, is the Commonwealth.

The Ruby Plane lies to the south of the Emerald Plane, separated from it by the Sea of Strife (which is around 175*dc* across).
A great mountain range runs through the center of the Ruby Plane; jungles cover the west, and much of the east, but there are deserts and a rocky, arid lowland in the northeast.
The Raptor Protectorate controls much of the jungles and mountains, while the Goblin Empire has conquored much of the arid land in the northeast; scattered other cultures lay between the two.
Much of the Ruby Plane remains unexplored; it extends well south, past the Raptor's southern borders.

[[designnote]]
| We have generally assumed a fairly Earth-like world.
| It is very slightly larger, is very slightly further fromm a very slightly larger star, and has a slightly longer orbital period of roughly 371 days — but has roughly the same surface gravity, axial tilt, and environment.
| 
| The world has 3 natural satelites — one is a large, dull, grey body similar to Luna (possibly carved from the primordial planet by an impact), while two are a much smaller, irregular, discolored objects (likely captured bodies).

[[designnote]]
| Dates will usually be given using the Commonwealth's calendar, which is based off of the solar year (like the Gregorian calendar in use on Earth).
| It's based on the year that the Old Charter was signed, founding the civilization that would become the Commonwealth.
| This occurred 830 years ago, so it's presently CY 830.
|
| Some cultures use a lunar calendar, typically based on the largest satellite.
| Much like on Earth, the lunar and solar calendars don't exactly line up; there are 11 lunar months (each 33 days long) and 9 days to a solar year.
| 
| Distances are often given in an old Empire-of-Man unit, the *demarc* (abbreviated dc); it's based on the distance from the center of city of Hanman to the furthest gate in its furthest wall.
| A *demarc* is about 2.6 miles, or about 4.2 kilometers.
| Another Empire-of-Man unit, the *stride* (sd), is used for smaller distances; it is, as the name implies, based on the average human stride.
| A *stride* is about 30 inches, or about 75 centimeters; there are about 5600 *strides* to a *demarc*.
|
| Their day is slightly longer than ours, but they also divide it into 24 equal units; we pretty much just call those "hours."

## History in Brief

### The Empire of Man

The Emerald Plane has long been populated by numerous intelligent races — some living in only one corner of it, others spread from coast to coast.
Much of the early history of these people is little more than legend now.

Humans are widely believed to be the first city-builders, founding the first cities on the Golden Peninsula (in the present-day Kingdoms of Men) at some point in the distant past.
Other cultures followed suit, founding cities and developing civilizations.

More than fourteen hundred years ago (in CY -578) Humans founded the city of Hanman in the Golden Peninsula.
It was one of several human cities that grew wealthy and powerful, claiming the territories around them.
Hanman was one of the three city-states that united (in CY -385) to form the Empire of Man.
The Empire of Man spread out from the Golden Peninsula, reaching west towars the Worldspine, well into the forrested inland.

The Empire founded colonies throughout its conquered territories, granting swaaths of land to local prominent citizens to settle, develop, and govern; many of these colonies prospered.
But the Empire was run for the benefit of the Three Cities, at the expense of its other posessions; it was also prone to factionalism and strife, as the Three Cities (and their leading citizens) jockeyed for power and influence.
As its distant territories grew and prospered, they began to chafe under the Three Cities' rule.

### Rebellion

The Drake's Peaks separate the Golden Peninsula from the rest of the Emerald Plane; thirty *demarc* west of those peaks, in the inland forest, roughly 130 years after the area had been conquered, the dragon Karrach began to conspire with local prominant citizens to throw off the Empire's rule.
They waited for an opportune moment; in CY -227, it came.
The Succession of the eigth Emperror Nallos Soriollon was hotly contested, and created a disruption of Imperial leadership; Karrach launched his rebellion, claiming a broad swath of the territory to the west of the Drake's Peaks for himself.

Karrach did not claim all of the lands that the Empire had conquered; former Imperial possessions to the south and west where cut off from the Three Cities and Imperial power.
These regions, equipped with their own nobility and institutions, continued to prosper and develop.

In CY -148, more than 80*dc* southwest of Karrach's domain, a Gnollish tribe sought the aide of the human city of *Autumn's Folk* against a powerful confederation of their enemies.
The humans agreed; their new Gnollish allies where granted a charter to found a manor in some nearby land, in exchange for their martial aid.

The people of *Autumn's Reach* prospered, along with their new Gnollish neighbors.
The charter granted to the Gnolls provided a kind of template; more manors where founded, by Humans, Gnolls and Halflings; some became city-centers in their own right.
The Old Charter proved an inadequate framework for the growing civilization; 148 years after the signing of the Old Charter, the New Charter was promulgated and signed.
The New Charter was designed to govern a civilization, the Commonwealth: it allowed for the collection of taxes, allowed for the funding of a militia and the construction of roads and bridges, and constructed the Commonwealth Council to administer those functions.

### The Growth of the Commonwealth
 
Members of the Commonwealth ventured into the frontiers, founding new manors and spreading their civilization.
New races where encountered; some joined the Commonwealth and where welcomed, while others wished now contact with the new civilization and where left alone — the forests of the inland Emerald Plane were vast and deep, with more than enough unclaimed land to support the Commonwealth's growth without requiring conquest or exploitation.
The Commonwealth eventually reached the Worldspine Mountains and the southern coast; they also stretched to the Goblin's Peaks in the southeast, where they first encountered the Goblin Kings.

In CY 87, the Empire of Man, cut off from its distant holdings and riven power-struggles, finally collapsed.

In CY 91, the Commonwealth founded the first manors west of the Worldspine.
They continued to expand west, founding a narrow thread of mannors running between the territories of the Herders and Shade Elves — eventually allying themselvs with the former, to resist the devastating mounted raids of the latter.

In CY 255, the first High Kingship was founded.

In CY 349, Islandhome was settled; it grew, becoming prosperous.
In CY 447, the forces of the Shaded Sea laid seige to it, leading to a short but shockingly brutal occupation; the seige was broken in spring of 448.

In CY 611, a brutal genocide in the Eastern Kingdoms lead to an exodus of Kobolds from those lands; those settlers where welcomed in the Commonwealth, settling chiefly under the Worldspine and in the Haven Isles.

The Commonwealth now spread from the shores of the Glass Sea in the East to the Haven Isles in the West, and included countless, diverse peoples.
The New Charter had not been designed to govern such a vast people; in CY 744, it was replaced with the Commonwealth Compact.
The Compact divided the Commonwealth into *provinces*, allowing each a government that suited it; it allowed the Council 

Commonwealth History

  - The charter that granted Gnolls a manor becomes an important
    document governing trade

  - Society benefits from strength of Gnolls

  - Bolstered by Gnolls, patrols secure countryside; trade flourishes,
    more manors founded.
    
      - “first charter” is used to administer relations between manors
        and city
      - it works but is unwieldy – it was never intended to build the
        government for a nation.

  - Eastern Empire collapses, an event nobody else cares about

  - 75 years later, New Charter replaces Old Charter: formally builds
    Charter Council.
    
      - New Charter is actually designed as a governing document
      - Any manor that signs the Charter is a member of the Commonwealth
      - “league of city-states” type arrangement: each Manor and City is
        still a “law unto itself”
      - The year the New Charter is signed is Charter Year 0 (CY 0)
      - Commonwealth Council cannot make law: all they do is tax trade,
        and use money to fund Army and maintain Roads
      - over next \~700 years, powers and missions expand, but are
        constrained by terms of charter. For example, some public
        schools opened, but run under road-building power, officially
        for the purpose of training engineers to build roads, bridges
        and dams.

  - Expand and flourish: cross World’s Spine mountains
    
      - other races (mostly) peacefully integrated: the manorial system
        is flexible, they’re simple granted manors.
      - Some Tribal Races refuse to integrate: the Commonwealth simply
        flows around their territories.
      - This does leave large swathes of unclaimed territories in the
        middle of the continent (the “Tribal Lands”, where tribal
        cultures still exist)

  - Feudalism takes root in territories of the Old Empire, Kingdoms
    built
    
      - This will give rise to the Kingdoms of Men, a messy web of small
        Kingdoms.

  - First manor on the Western side of the World Spine signs charter in
    CY 91.

  - Dwarves encountered in the North in CY 103.

  - In CY 325, the Western coast is reached; in CY 350, the Haven Isles
    are reached, and Islandholm is settled.

  - CY 350, Karrach surrenders power of nobility, Dragonshire governed
    by “house of commons”

  - In CY 447, Shaded Sea People attack Islandholme and occupy it –
    briefly. Commonwealth counter-attack is devastating, liberating
    island twenty days later and shattering the forces of the houses
    that mounted it.
    
      - Surviving Shade Elves are imprisoned in short term, slowly
        integrated into Commonwealth society. Ash elves are their
        descendants

  - CY 611, Kobolds flee genocide in eastern portion of Human Kingdoms;
    peacefully incorporated into Commonwealth
    
      - Many settle in World’s Spine mountains, many more continue to
        the Haven Isles.
      - Many probably settle in the Dragonshire, which sits between the
        Commonwealth and Kingdoms and has a large population that can
        speak their languages.

  - CY 750, Commonwealth Compact replaces Commonwealth Charter
    
      - The Commonwealth no works like a league of nations.
    
      - Commonwealth territory split into Provinces and City-States:
        
          - each province organizes itself
          - city-states are independent of provinces, have their own
            top-level status.
    
      - The Commonwealth Council still can’t make law, but it has
        broader funding powers – no longer just armies and civil
        engineers, can now undertake civil projects (like schools)
        directly
    
      - Dragonshire formally incorporated as a Province (it was an
        independent allied nation)
    
      - Clay Men formally incorporated (where formerly and allied
        people)
    
      - The Herders and their alliance are formally incorporated (they
        where also an allied people).
    
      - Commonwealth Compact has an “enumeration of freedoms” that each
        Province (and each Manor) must provide.
