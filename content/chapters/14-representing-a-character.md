## Characters

Characters have the following:

  - Aptitudes
    
      - represents a character’s fundamental mental abilities—how
        intelligent they are, how intuitive they are, etc.
    
      - Each Aptitude has a *rating* between 5 and 40, representing your
        character’s ability with that aptitude.
    
      - Cognition (COG): your characters ability to analyze, reason and
        plan.
    
      - Coordination (COO): your characters ability to manage their
        posture and balance, their ability to get their body into
        different configurations, and their reaction speed.
    
      - Intuition (INT): your character’s ability to pick up on
        patterns, to master “unwritten rules” and pick up on
        subconscious queues.
    
      - Savvy (SAV): your character’s ability to manage social
        situations.
    
      - Somatics (SOM): your character’s ability to manage your body.
    
      - Willpower (WIL): your character’s self-discipline.
    
      - Sidebar: Somatics is a mental aptitude?
        
          - Somatics (SOM) sounds like some kind of “mental strength
            score.” How does that make sense?
          - Partly, that’s just to make the skill system work: some
            physical skills (like Unarmed Combat) need an attribute to
            be linked to—or else we’d need to build special cases for
            them into the rules. We inherited that from Eclipse Phase.
          - However, that’s also how the body *actually works*. The
            central nervous system has to learn to recruit and manage
            the muscles of the body, and some people really do learn to
            do this better than others\!
    
      - Sidebar: Do REF and WIL matter?
        
          - Players who read the skill section might notice that some
            aptitudes are linked to many more skills than others;
            notably, REF is linked to two skills, and WIL is linked to
            only one\! Does that mean that REF and WIL don’t matter?
          - Absolutely not\! Your aptitudes can also be used to compute
            derived stats, and they may also be used in aptitude checks.
          - This is *especially* true of REF and WIL. REF is part of
            your INIT, and REF × 3 is used to catch things—including to
            grab on to something when falling. WIL is even more
            important, since it determines your Lucidity and WIL × 3
            checks are used to resist fear and stress.
    
      - Sidebar: Does WIL matter?
        
          - Players who read the skill section might notice that some
            aptitudes are linked to many more skills than others;
            notably, WIL is linked to only one skill—Control\! Does that
            mean that WIL doesn’t matter?
          - Absolutely not\! WIL is used to determine your LUC (and with
            it, your TT and IR), and WIL×3 checks are commonly used to
            resist fear and stress.

  - A race, which gives you
    
      - Health and Strength values,
        
          - which represent that race’s physical strength and
            durability.
    
      - Aptitude bonuses,
        
          - which represent faculties that the race is particularly good
            (or bad) at.
    
      - Senses and movement modes
    
      - A size
        
          - playable races are usually size Medium, about human sized;
            they are sometimes Large or Small.
    
      - special characteristics,
        
          - which represent unique quirks or abilities that the race
            has—like a Gnoll’s thick hide, or a Shifter’s ability to
            change shape.

  - Ranks in skills
    
      - representing the things your character has learned to do.
      - (Your character’s ability to speak different languages is
        represented by the Language skill.)

  - Traits
    
      - represent quirks your character has, like being ambidextrous.

  - Powers
    
      - representing special abilities that your character has.
      - Like a special sword maneuver that your character is good at, or
        having the ability to manifest a ball of fire.

  - A Background
    
      - represent where your character is from.
      - provides you with ranks in skills, and sometimes other benefits.

  - Classes
    
      - represent associations your characters has
      - these either represent some organization that you can call on
        for aide, or they let you “break a rule” in an interesting way.
      - I’m worried point A could be done with traits, and point B could
        be done with powers

  - Vital Statistics (which are derived from your other choices)
    
      - Durability (DUR)
        
          - determined by your race, possibly adjusted by effects,
            traits or Tweak Points)
    
      - Wound Threhsold (WT)
        
          - DUR ÷ 5
    
      - Death Rating (DR)
        
          - DUR × 2
    
      - Lucidity (LUC)
        
          - WIL × 2
    
      - Trauma Threshold (TT)
        
          - LUC ÷ 5
    
      - Insanity Rating (IR)
        
          - LUC × 2
    
      - Initiative Score (INIT)
        
          - (INT + COO) ÷ 5
          - Well, that’s the *Combat* initiative score.
    
      - Damage Bonus (DB)
        
          - (SOM + STR) ÷ 10
    
      - Luck and Luck Points
        
          - (you start with 1 Luck, and can purchase more during
            character creation.)

  - Some limits always apply. Characters may not have:
    
      - more than 70 ranks in a skill
      - an aptitude higher than 40 (any excess is wasted)
      - more than 10 Luck
      - more than 50 DUR or STR
