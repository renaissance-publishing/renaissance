title: "Backgrounds, Traits, Classes and Powers"
---

See the Character Creation rules.

Traits work more or less like EP Traits, and Powers are distantly
inspired by EP Sleights. In terms of this game, Backgrounds give you a
package of skills, traits and items that represent your upbringing,
Traits give you some useful property, Powers give you a special action
you can perform – usually, and Classes let you “break the rules” in
limited and interesting ways – for example, Soldier let you use the
Assist action during combat.

## Backgrounds

  - Guidelines
    
      - Should give you a few skills, possibly a Trait
        
          - should give you *ranks* and not a bonus, because of how
            buying skills works.
          - Really shouldn’t include EP-style “buy at half price”, those
            are obscenely strong.
          - Should probably provide about 40 CP-worth of bonuses
    
      - Backgrounds shouldn’t give you something you can’t get anywhere
        else. Instead, they should give you a “starting package” at no
        cost.
    
      - Hint: Backgrounds can award Traits, Classes and even Powers –
        it’s not a bad trick for making them more interesting, and
        it’s useful if a Class, Trait or Power is important to a given
        theme.
    
      - These backgrounds are general backgrounds – the kind of
        backgrounds that anybody might have, and that might exist in any
        province. If you want a more specific backgrounds, you can make
        it an optional background for a given race.

## Traits

Traits represent special properties about your character. In general,
Traits are not actions; they are always in effect during play.

  - Alert: You are particularly aware of your surroundings. You take no
    penalty to passive Perception tests.

  - Ambidextrous: Choose one of your hands: you may now use that hand as
    well as your dominant hand. Notably, this means that the penalties
    for using an Off-Handed Weapon would not apply when using that hand.
    (Characters with more than two hands may take the Ambidextrous trait
    repeatedly, if they wish to have more of their limbs be “dominant
    hands”.)

  - Brave: your character receives a +20 bonus to tests to resist fear
    or intimidation

  - Common Sense: you know a good idea (or a bad one\!) when you see it.
    Once per game, you may ask the GM whether some particular action is
    a *good idea* or not; alternatively, the GM may warn you that
    something you are about to do is a *bad idea*.

  - Disciplined: You are particularly good at self-control. After you
    roll a test that includes your WIL, you may spend 1 Luck to Upgrade.

  - High Pain Tolerance: your character can *negate* the effect of one
    wound.

  - Limber: Your character is very lithe, and receives a +10 bonus on
    checks where this would be beneficial, such as trying to escape
    bindings or squeeze through tight spaces.

  - Ready: you may spend a Luck Point to re-roll your initiative.
    
      - ~~~original idea: +2 INIT~~~
      - ~~~possible better idea: once per combat, you may move to head of the initiative order for the following turn.~~~
      - ~~~or roll your INIT twice, and take the best result.~~~
      - I like both of those more, I think, because I usually prefer
        abilities that are really interesting discretely over ones that
        do a little bit constantly. And also because I prefer people
        invest in good Aptitutdes if they want good numbers. But it
        might also be OK, since INIT isn’t a skill and you can’t invest
        in it directly.
      - ~~~In combat, you may spend a Luck Point to move to the head of the initiative order.~~~

  - Resilient: you are particularly mentally durable. You can negate one
    Trauma.

  - Social Animal: you are particularly well-suited to large groups and
    complex social situations. You may spend a Luck Point to reroll a
    social skill check.

  - Strong: you are particularly strong. This increases your STR by 5.

  - Thrifty
    
      - You have a knack for getting the most out of your money.
      - You have one additional wealth dot at each level.

  - Tough: you are particularly tough. This increases your DUR by 5;
    this changes your WT and DR as well.

Some traits are *negative traits*. A negative trait imposes a *penalty*,
but taking it *gives* you more CP to spend.

  - Distinctive: you have some very distinctive characteristic, which
    makes you very recognizable. You take a -20 penalty on Disguise
    checks, and on Stealth checks to blend into a crowd.
  - Enemy: some foe is determined to see you fall. They might be someone
    who is actively hunting you, they might be someone in a position of
    power who will make your life miserable at every opportunity, or
    they might be something else. In any case, they are a frequent
    source of frustration for you, showing up to foil your plans at the
    worst possible times.
  - Frail: you are not as hardy as other members of your race. This
    decreases your DUR by 5; this alters your DR and WT as well. You
    cannot take both this trait and the Tough trait.
  - Illiterate: You cannot read or write.
  - Meek: No-one would describe you as “brave”: you have a -20 penalty
    to tests to resist fear or intimidation. You cannot take both this
    and the Brave trait.
  - Social Stigma: you are part of a group, organization or movement
    that people have a negative view of. You take penalties on Social
    skills (these skills depend heavily on the situation, and are up to
    GM discression). These penalties should apply at least some of the
    time where you live.
  - Wanted: you are wanted by some government, order or noble. You
    occasionally have to hide from bounty-hunters, duck guards, or worry
    about being turned in by any less-than-scrupulous people you
    encounter.
  - Weak: you are weaker than the norm for your race. You have -5 STR.
    You cannot take both this and the Strong trait.

Some traits are *neutral*, giving you both a benefit and a drawback;
they do not cost CP.

  - Hardened: You have been exposed to some source of stress repeatedly,
    and have become resistant to it; however, doing so has taken a toll.
    
      - Choose one particular source of stress: you gain +WIL to checks
        made to resist it, but your Luck stat is reduced by 1.
      - Example sources of stress include *being gravely injured in
        combat;* *failing one of your motivational goals spectacularly;
        witnessing, experiencing or performing torture* and *displays of
        extreme supernatural power.*
      - Right now, this is borrowed fairly directly from EP, but I’d
        like to adapt it to the game and setting more. Maybe reduce LUC
        by 5 instead?

  - Unique Outlook: You have some personal philosophy or outlook that
    causes you to process some situation vary differently than other
    people do; on the plus side, this allows you to weather some
    situations that others would find stressful, but on the down side,
    this also makes it harder for others to relate to you.
    
      - Choose one particular source of Stress: you gain +WIL to checks
        made to resist it, but you suffer a -10 penalty to Persuasion
        and Protocol tests.
      - Note sure about that one either, I had the idea that instead
        “your critical successes with Social Skills are ignored” or
        something like it.

## Classes

  - Guidelines for Creating Classes
    
      - Most classes either represent an association (that should be
        useful to players during the game), or let them “cheat” in some
        interesting way (i.e. by stepping around something that’s
        normally a rule).
        
          - Classes shouldn’t give them new actions that they can
            perform: those should be Powers.
          - Classes shouldn’t give players ranks or fixed bonuses in
            skills; that should happen in Backgrounds and Traits.
    
      - “20 ranks in 2 skills” is a good rule of thumb for most class
        requirements – but obviously not all of them
    
      - Classes should not be *mandatory* for a given character concept.
        A character with 85 in One-Handed Weapons should be a master
        sword-fighter, and should be perfectly effective as a
        sword-fighter without any classes (or powers). So, if you’re
        working on a class that would be functionally mandatory for
        every sword-fighter, or that just means “is a master
        sword-fighter,” then something has gone wrong.
        
          - The biggest exception are Classes that directly represent a
            social role, like Noble and Officer.

  - Class whose names are italicized are dependent on specific locals,
    spirits or characters, and so won’t make sense “just anywhere.” They
    are intended more as examples of the kinds of things that players
    might come up with to customize their characters, or that GMs might
    use to “flesh out” a unique local.

  - Artisan of the Dead
    
      - Requirements: 30 Ranks in Spellcraft, the Corpse-Herder class
      - You can modify your corpse companion. Such a modification
        requires time, raw materials and an appropriate Spellcraft
        check. Possible modifications are listed below:
      - Armored: your companion gains 4 armor. Requires: 1 hour
        task-action, a corpse, scraps of armor.
      - Monstrous: you heavily strengthen and reinforce your companion,
        which gains +5 STR and +10 DUR. Requires: 1 hour task-action,
        two corpses.
      - Hulk: your companion is a heavily-armored hulk capable of
        shrugging off massive damage. Its gains 6 more armor (so that it
        has a total of 10 armor). Requires: 2 hour task-action, one
        corpse, armor scraps; companion must have Armored and Monstrous
        traits.
      - Fast: you carefully craft your companion to be lean and quick.
        It’s walking movement is increased to 5/15. Requires: 2 hour
        task action, a corpse. Cannot have the armored or monstrous
        options.
      - Flight: you attach great wings to your companion, allowing it to
        fly. It gains flying movement 4/12. Requires: 2 hour task
        action, large amounts of hide. Cannot have the armored or
        monstrous options.
      - Claws: you graft ferocious claws onto your companion’s hands and
        feet. It gains claws that do 1d10+4+DB DV damage, and have AP
        -2. Requires a thirty-minute task action, claws or scrap metal.

  - *Attendant of the Mourner*
    
      - Requirements: 20 Ranks in one Combat skill, 20 Ranks in
        Research, the Cleric class.
      - You are a devotee of the Mourner, and you have pledged yourself
        to the pursuit of history and (enlightened) justice.
      - In a site holy to the Mourner (a library, museum, court-house or
        similar), or while pursuing a perpetrator of cruelty or
        injustice on a great scale, before making a Combat skill check,
        a Research check, an Intimidate check or a check to Resist Fear,
        you may spend 1 Luck Point to gain +WIL to your check.

  - Channeler
    
      - Requirement: 20 ranks in Control, two Sleights
      - You have such long experience with your sleights that
        maintaining them is almost automatic. You reduce the penalty for
        sustaining Sleights by 10. (So, for example, if you are
        sustaining 4 Sleights, you take a -20 penalty to all checks,
        instead of the normal -30.)

  - Corpse-Herder
    
      - Requirement: 20 Ranks in Spellcraft, 10 ranks in Knowledge:
        Theology
      - You can create a powerful companion from the remains of the
        dead—and you can heal and modify your companion with more
        remains.
      - You can create a companion as a one-hour Task Action requiring a
        Spellcraft check; you need access to at least one corpse (of
        medium size or larger) to provide raw material.
      - When you create your companion, it has DUR 30, STR 30, and a
        movement of Walking 4/12. It only a very rudimentary
        intelligence: it has SOM 15 and WILL 20, and a score of 5 in its
        other attributes. (You create this basic intelligence, it does
        not come from the corpse you used.)
      - Your companion will obey any simple command you give it; absent
        orders from you, it will follow you and defend you.
      - When you create your companion, you may distribute 200 ranks
        among its various skills. You cannot assign it more than ten
        ranks in any Knowledge skill, and you cannot assign it more
        ranks in a skill than you have.
      - Your companion has the Supernatural tag, and does not need to
        eat, drink, sleep or breath. It is unaffected by poison and
        disease (though it can carry diseases).
      - Your companion doesn’t heal naturally, and Medicine is useless
        on it. However, you may attempt to repair it if it is damaged.
        If you have a corpse to work with, you may attempt to repair it;
        this is a thirty-minute Task Action requiring a Spellcraft
        check. If you succeed, one wound is removed, and your companion
        recovers 1d10 DV. (Note, the wound is *removed*, not bound.)

  - Daredevil
    
      - Requirements: 5 or more Luck
      - You have a history of taking extraordinary risks, and a habit of
        succeeding.
      - Before a check, you may spend 1 Luck to get a +20 bonus on that
        check.

  - Duelist
    
      - Requirements: 20 Ranks in one Melee Skill
      - As a Quick Action, you can designate one other Creature as your
        Rival. You gain a +10 bonus to checks to combat skills that your
        target is opposing (that is, to your attack when attacking them,
        and to your defense when defending against them). However, you
        take -10 to combat skills that your Rival isn’t opposing (that
        is, when attacking other characters, or when defending against
        other characters).
      - Thaaaaaats basically a power, hmmm.

  - Familiar-Bound Mage
      - Requirements: 20 Ranks in Spellcraft
      - You have crafted (or attracted) a *familiar.*
      - Familiars are small magical assistants, bound to the mage that they serve.
      - Familiars vary widely; some are small animals to which a magical intelligence has been added; others are small golems, sophisticated clockwork creations that function as living things; still others might be small spirits in their own right, conjured and bound to the mage.
      - Nearly all are small, intelligent creatures; though they are of little use in combat, they can be a great help in a laboratory or shop--and some can have other skills.
      - You may choose one creature that has the Familiar tag; you gain this creature as a familiar.
      - Alternatively, you may design your own familiar, but your GM must approve of your selection.
      - Your familiar gains a COG of 10 (unless its COG is already higher).
      - You can distribute +15 points to the familiar's aptitudes.
      - You may spend up to 200 CP on your familiar.
      - Your familiar is magically linked to you; it can understand you when you speak, and you can understand it (regardless of the language that you use, even if it doesn'ts peak a language), and

      - Conversely, you have obligations to the gang, such as performing
        smuggling runs, intimidating targets or crafting drugs.

      - However, you have obligations to your guild, including dues

  - Thief
  - Wizard
  - Attach motivations to classes?

## Powers

Powers generally list the type of action they require, and the effect
when used.  Some powers also have prerequisites. Note that a “power” is
not necessarily supernatural: martial maneuvers also use the same rules,
and are thus listed here.

  - Fireball: You can manifest a fireball in your hand.
    
      - Requires: 10 ranks in Spellcraft
    
      - Action: Quick Action
    
      - Effect: held ball of fire
        
          - After it is created, treat the ball of fire as you would any
            other held object. The ball of fire will not burn you or any
            possession that you are in contact with, but it will burn
            other objects (or people).
          - If the ball of fire looses contact with you (as it will if
            it is thrown, for example), it can persist for up to 5 turns
            (about 15 seconds) on its own; otherwise, it can persist as
            long as you hold on to it.
          - You can voluntarily dismiss the ball of fire (which is
            handy, because sleeping with a ball of fire in your hand is
            ill-advised).
          - The ball of fire is, of course, fire, and effects other
            objects as such. (It will burn other people for 1d10 DV,
            plus 1 per ten ranks of Spellcraft.)

  - Exploding Fireball:
    
      - Requires: Fireball and 20 ranks in Spellcraft
      - When using the Fireball power, when your fireball expires
        (either because you dismissed it or because it left contact with
        you), you may choose to have it explode. Treat this as a Blast
        effect, which does (your fireball’s damage) at its center.

  - Intense Fire:
    
      - Requires: 20 ranks in Spellcraft
      - Effect: Your fire spells do an additional 1d10 DV of damage and
        have AP -1.

  - Jump
    
      - Requires: 10 ranks in Spellcraft
      - Action: Quick Action
      - Effect: You teleport, moving up to twice your Running movement.

  - Group Jump
    
      - Requires: Jump, 20 ranks in Spellcraft
      - Effect: when you teleport ~~using Jump, Long Jump, Journey or
        Pilot~~, you may take objects or other people with you. You may
        carry either one normal-sized person or 50 Kg of cargo per 10
        ranks in Spellcraft.

  - Long Jump
    
      - Requires: Jump, 20 ranks in Spellcraft
      - Action: Standard Action
      - Effect: You teleport, moving up to 10 times your Running
        movement.

  - Journey
    
      - Requires: Long Jump, 30 ranks in Spellcraft
      - Action: Task Action (1 minute)
      - Effect: You teleport, moving up to ~~2 kilometers per meter of
        running movement~~ 2 kilometer per 10 ranks in Spellcraft.

  - Pilot
    
      - Requires: Journey, Group Jump
      - Action: Task Action (10 minutes)
      - Effect: You can use a Kairne to teleport; when you do so, you
        can teleport to any other Kairne in the network.

  - Master
    
      - Requires: 10 Control
    
      - Action: Sustained
    
      - Effect: You can use your own intrinsic magic to control (and
        fortify) your own life processes.
        
          - While sustaining this power, you receive a +20 bonus to
            checks to Endure Physical Hardship.
          - While sustaining this power, you gain +1 Armor.

      - Action: None
    
      - You have permanently integrated magical energies into your own
        life processes.
    
      - Effect:
        
          - You gain the Empowered tag;
          - you receive a +10 bonus to tests to Endure Physical Hardship;
          - you only need to eat and sleep half as much, and
          - you gain +1 Armor.

      - Made a class, since it isn't an action.

  - Down-Time
    
      - Requires: Transcend, 20 Control
    
      - Action: 4-Hour Task Action
    
      - You can enter a deep, meditative state, in which you can
        nourish, refresh and repair both your mind and body.
    
      - Effect:
        
          - After completing the use of this Sleight, you do not need to eat or sleep for 1 day.
          - After completing the Sleight, you recover 1d10&div;3 Stress.
          - While sustaining this Sleight, you are very difficult to wake; other people will need to shake you violently to wake you (a Standard Action). Other similarly violent actions  will wake you—if the building you are in collapses, or if you are attacked, for example. If you are roused from the Sleight before it completes, you suffer a -10 penalty from the exhaustion and disorientation for 1 day.
          - Special: if you have the Heal Sleight, you may also sustain it during Down Time.

  - Fortify
    
      - Requires: 20 Control
    
      - Action: Sustained
    
      - Effect: you can fortify your physical and mental abilities.
        
          - While you sustain this Sleight, you receive a +5 bonus to one of your Aptitudes, to your Strength, or to your Durability.
          - (Your derived stats would also change, as normal.)

  - Heal
    
      - Requires: 10 Control
    
      - Action: Sustained
    
      - Effect: Your wounds begin to heal.
        
          - While sustaining this power, you have Fast Healing 1.
          - While sustaining this power, you may attempt a Control check as a Quick Action; if you succeed, you instead have Fast Healing 2.
          - Special: if you have a few minutes to focus yourself (i.e., when you are out of combat, the GM may allow you to progress to Fast Healing 2 without requiring a check.

  - Transfer
    
      - Requires: 10 Control
    
      - Action: Sustained
    
      - Condition: To use this power, you must be touching one other
        creature (which must have a DUR rating). ~~This creature is the
        target.~~
    
      - Effects: You transfer wounds from a creature that you touch to
        yourself.
        
          - For every turn that you sustain this power, you take 2 DV;
            if you do, the creature you are touching is either healed
            healed for 2 DUR, or one ongoing bleed effect is ended (you
            choose which).
          - This power cannot “transfer” wounds in this way, nor can it
            heal diseases, congenital defects or poisons.

  - Regrowth
    
      - Requires: Heal, 20 Control
      - Action: Task Action (1 Hour)
      - Effect: Roll a Control check. If you succeed, you heal one
        wound.

  - Sacrifice
    
      - Requires: Transfer, 20 Control
      - Action: Task Action (1 minute)
      - Condition: To use this power, you must be sustaining Transfer
      - Effect: You suffer one wound; if you do, the person you are
        Transfer-ing wounds from is healed for one wound.
      - Using sacrifice can be stressfull. A WIL&times;3 test can be called
        for to use this power; if the power is used successfully, Stress
        might be inflicted.

  - Join
    
      - Requires: 10 Ranks in Control
      - Action: Sustained
      - Condition: To use this Power, you must be touching one
        character; this character is the target of the Power. If you
        loose physical contact with the target, the power ends.
      - Effect: You join minds with the target, creating a Gestalt.
        Normally, this is an equal blending; however, under some
        circumstances – particularly if the target is unwilling – the
        two minds might fight for dominance over the Gestalt. Treat this
        as an opposed WIL&times;3 check, with the winner gaining dominance,
        and thereafter being able to direct the actions of the gestalt.
      - The gestalt mind has access to the skills, knowledge and
        memories of both individuals. The gestalt mind will also express
        the desires of both minds – even if one mind has become
        dominant, the other mind in the Gestalt cannot be suppressed
        completely.
      - Unsurprisingly, this can be extremely traumatic – this is almost
        always the case when the target is unwilling.
      - Physical action is very difficult, given that one character must
        maintain physical contact with another – but it can be
        attempted. Appropriate penalties apply (usually -30).
      - For simplicity, assume that the Gestalt functions as one
        character, at least in so far as it has one initiative score and
        has the same allotment of actions that any individual character
        would have.

  - Link
    
      - Requires: Join, 20 Ranks in Control
      - Action: Task Action (5 minutes)
      - Condition: To use this power, you must be sustaining Join.
      - While sustaining Join, you can Link your mind with the target.
        Thereafter, as long as you continue to sustain Join, you can
        break physical contact with the target and maintain the Gestalt.
        This makes physical action far more feasible.
      - The targets cannot get more than (Your ranks in Control)&times;2
        meters apart from one-another, or the effect ends.

  - Collective
    
      - Requires: Join, Link, 30 Ranks in Control
      - Condition: You must be sustaining Join, and you must have Linked
        with the target.
      - You can incorporate more than one mind into the Gestalt created
        by Join. To add a new mind, you must use Join on that mind, and
        you must then Link that mind.
      - To remain in the Gestalt, ever element of the collective must be
        within the given range of at least one other element of the
        collective (they can form a chain).
      - Fights for dominance among collectives are more complicated.
        Generally, only two participants should be rolling against each
        other at any given time. Minds who can co-exist peacefully can
        nominate the strongest among them to represent their interests,
        and they can even potentially assist one-another. However, being
        a component of a large collective that is not at peace with
        itself can be a traumatic experience for all involved, even the
        “victors” in the fight for dominance.

  - Shield Bash
    
      - Requires: 10 Ranks in Blunt Weapons
      - Effect: you can hurt people with a shield about as well as other
        people can with a weapon. You can use your shield as a weapon,
        using your Blunt Weapons skill and doing 1d10+2+DB DV (AP -).

  - Sneak Attack
    
      - Requires: 10 ranks in an Attack skill.
      - Effect: You are particularly good at striking weak spots. When
        you attack an unaware or helpless target, you inflict an
        additional 1d10 DV.

  - Blur
    
      - Requires: 10 Ranks in Spellcraft, 10 Ranks in Stealth
    
      - Action: Sustained
    
      - Effect: You become translucent, making you hard to spot.
        
          - You gain +10 bonus to Stealth checks to avoid being seen.

  - Vanish
    
      - Requires: Blur, 20 Ranks in Spellcraft, 20 Ranks in Stealth
    
      - Effect: Your Blur improves; you become so difficult to spot that
        others may fail to notice you even if you are standing in plain
        sight.
        
          - You gain (another) +10 bonus to Stealth checks to avoid
            being seen.
          - You may use Stealth to avoid being seen even if you do not
            have anything to hide behind. Such a Stealth check suffers a
            -20 modifier.

  - Charm
    
      - Requires: 10 Ranks in Persuasion, 10 Ranks in Spellcraft
    
      - Action: Task Action (5 Minutes)
    
      - Effect: Conversation with you is enchanting, in a very literal
        sense.
        
          - As you spend time in conversation with someone, you can
            exert a magical influence over them.
          - Make an opposed test, your Persuasion versus their Resist
            Social Manipulation (SAV + INT). If you succeed, they will
            regard you as a friend, and will view your words and actions
            in the best possible light.
          - This does not grant you magical control of their actions, it
            simply implies that they will trust you and regard you
            favorably.

  - Push
    
      - Requires: Charm, 20 Ranks in Spellcraft
    
      - Effect: you have the ability to “push” your will onto other
        people.
        
          - When you Charm someone, you may attempt a Persuasion check,
            opposed by their Resist Social Manipulation. If you win,
            then you may give them a single instruction, which they will
            carry out to the best of their ability.
    
      - Not sure about this one, did it quick. Wanted to avoid this with
        the base Charm; mind control can get obscene.

  - ~~Weave~~:
    
      - Requires: 10 Ranks in Athletics, 10 Ranks in Fray
    
      - Action: Standard Action
    
      - Effect: You are particularly good at evasive movement.
        
          - In combat, you may take a Standard Action to *move evasively*. You may move up to your running rate. Until the beginning of your next turn, you may defend with your Athletics skill, and you gain +20 to your defenses.
          - You don’t have to actually move from your space to use this power. Using Weave without moving might represent focusing all your attention on parrying incoming blows, for example.
          - You get the +20 bonus to checks made to defend yourself, whether you use Athletics to defend or not. You can defend with Fray and still get the +20 bonus, for example.

      - This power is unnecessary now that we added evasive movement back.

  - Quick Counter:
    
      - Requires: 10 Ranks in Unarmed Combat dunno about that
    
      - Action: Quick Action
    
      - Effect: You are very good at countering your opponents attacks
        with a nasty joint lock.
        
          - Until the beginning of your next turn, if you are attacked
            in melee, defend with your Unarmed Skill, win the opposed
            check (that is, successfully defend against an attack), and
            score an Exceptional Success, then you automatically grapple
            the person who attacked you.

  - Quick Break:
    
      - Requires: Quick Counter, 20 Ranks in Unarmed Combat
    
      - Effect: when you counter an opponent, you may instead choose to
        break a joint.
        
          - When you Quick Counter an opponent, instead of grappling
            them, you may choose to inflict a single Wound.

  - Blank
    
      - Requires: 20 Ranks in Deception
    
      - Action: Sustained
    
      - Effect: though it requires some concentration, you have an
        uncanny ability to blank your expression, replacing it with
        pleasant neutral demeanor.
        
          - While sustaining this power, Read checks made against you
            suffer a -30 penalty.
          - However, because your neutral expression makes it hard to
            convey your emotional state—and might be a little unnerving.
            You suffer a -10 penalty to Persuasion checks.
          - Having no penalty to Barter is deliberate, the theory being
            that this kind of behavior is expected while haggling;
            likewise, no bonus on Deception was offered, because a bonus
            to one side of a check coupled with a penalty to the other
            is a little stiff. Thoughts?
          - This isn’t a supernatural power; it’s just having a really
            good poker face. Therefore, it’s neither a Sleight, a Spell,
            a Boon or a Maneuver; it’s basically just a Power.

  - Conjure
    
      - Requires: 10 Ranks in Spellcraft
    
      - Action: Sustained
    
      - Effect: you can form magic into physical forms, which can mimic
        simple objects.
        
          - While you sustain this power, you can create either three
            items with cost category Minor, or one object with cost
            category Medium.
          - You choose the objects when you first use the Power.
          - The objects cannot have complex clockwork, cannot be
            alchemical or otherwise magic, and cannot sustain chemical
            reactions; you can form cups, knives, jugs, bags, and
            blades, for example; but you cannot summon potions,
            explosives, clocks, food or living creatures.
          - The objects you form are partially translucent, and glow
            with a ghostly energy; though you can control their
            appearance up to a point, they are obviously magical
            creations.
          - The objects works just like their mundane versions; they
            don’t hover or act on their own, for example.

  - Eidolon:
    
      - Don’t like the name
    
      - Requires: Conjure, 10 Ranks in Control, 20 Ranks in Spellcraft
    
      - Action: Sustained
    
      - Effect: you can form magic into the shape of a living creature,
        and you can fracture your mind so that you can control them.
        
          - You get one creature, hereafter called an Eidolon.
          - Each Eidolon is Small, has 15 DUR and 20 STR, has a movement
            of Walking 3/9, has Normal Senses, and has the Spirit,
            Humanoid and Eidolon tags. As magical apparitions, they
            don’t need to eat, drink, breath or sleep.
          - The Eidolon does not have a mind of its own; rather, you
            control its actions, as if it was an extension of your body.
            This means that it uses your Aptitudes and Skill Ranks;
            appropriate powers, classes and traits may also be used
            through your Eidolon, at the GM’s discretion.
          - Mechanically, the you can use your actions to either act
            through your Character, or to have your Eidolon act. So, for
            example, during your turn you could use a Quick Action to
            have your character move, and a Standard Action to attack
            with your Eidolon.
          - You may choose three bonuses for the Eidolon from the
            Bonuses list.
    
      - Bonuses:
        
          - Carapace: the Eidolon has a sturdy shell, thick hide, or is
            otherwise reinforced; it gains 4 Armor.
        
          - Claws: the Eidolon gains claws:
            
              - Attack: Unarmed Combat, 1D10+1+DB, -2 AP; Tags: Natural
                Weapon, Off-Hand.
        
          - Form: the Eidolon gains the appearance of an animal; it
            appears to be a normal creature of the given type. (Its
            stats don’t change, and it is immediately obvious to anyone
            with Mage Sight that it is a magical conjuration.)
        
          - Regen: the Eidolon has Fast Healing 2.
        
          - Sense: the Eidolon gains the benefit of one of your Senses.
            (e.g. if you have Magesight, then you may give the Eidolon
            Mage Sight.)
        
          - Size: the Eidolon is Size Medium.
        
          - Sturdy: the Eidolon has +10 DUR and +5 STR.
        
          - Wings: the Eidolon has wings; it gains the following
            movement mode: Fly (5/15)

  - Enhanced Eidolon
    
      - Requires: Eidolon, 20 Ranks in Spellcraft
    
      - Effect: you have more Bonuses available. You can select from the
        following list, as well as the Bonus list above:
        
          - Ethereal: the Eidolon can become intangible for short
            periods of time. It gains the following Power:
            
              - Action: Quick Action
              - Effect: the Eidolon becomes intangible. Until its next
                turn, it can pass straight through solid objects, and
                solid objects will pass through it. This means it cannot
                be damaged by weapons, but it also means that it cannot
                (practically) attack other Creatures, or interact with
                objects.
        
          - Fire: a fire simmers within the Eidolon, and it can flare
            forth. The fire provides illumination like a torch. The
            Eidolon also gains the following Power:
            
              - Action: Sustained
              - Effect: the Eidolon flares forth, becoming a creature of
                flame. Anything in contact with it suffers 1D10 damage.
                Its natural attacks gain the Fire tag, and cause an
                additional 1D10 DV.
        
          - Frost: the Eidolon is suffused with frost, appearing to be
            made from chipped ice. The Eidolon gains +2 Armor and +5
            DUR, and it gains the following Power:
