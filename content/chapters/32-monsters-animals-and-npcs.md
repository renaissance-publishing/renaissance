### Bahla

A *Bahla* is a small animal much like a rabbit — except that it's larger, about the size of a large cat; wooly like a sheep; and more social and docile.
Bahla live in groups of 9 to 12; some kinds of bahla live in burrows, while others live in larger flocks.
Washers often kept bahlas as pets, and herded them for wool and meat; after the loss of their homeland, some washers carried the creatures into exile in the Protectorate.
Populations of wiled Bahla still roam in the hilly uplands of the western Ruby Plane.

### Chasseh Forrest Spirit

The spirits that dwell in the woods south of the human town of Chasseh have the ability to take control of the wildlife that is native to their forest.
These spirits are mercurial, and not particularly friendly; though they can be bargained with, they are typically somewhere between unhelpful and dangerous.

A possessed animal uses the animal’s stats, but gains the Aptitudes, Skill Ranks and Powers from the spirit.
You may assign Aptitude Bonuses appropriate to the creature, +10 to one Aptitude and +5 to another.

If the animal is killed, the spirit simply departs from it, fleeing into the forests.

### Clay Pot

"Clay pots" are small constructed familiars.
They need not be constructed out of clay: they are named because of a famous example that had a spherical, clay chassis.

      - Hardened: your clay pot is forged of sturdy materials, such as iron; it gains \+10 DUR and \+3 Armor.
      - Heat: your clay pot has metallic hands, which it can bring to a burning heat; it can use these to melt wax, burn the unwelcome (requiring a touch-only attack and dealing 1d10&div;2 DV) or start small fire.
      - Levitation: your clay pot hovers just above the ground, allowing it to glide over rough terrain, minor obstacles or water.  It exchanges its Bipedal movement for Hover movement of the same rate.
      - Plated: your clay pot is forged from steel, or some other sturdy material; it gains \+5 DUR and \+3 Armor.  (Requires: Hardened.)
      - Swift: your clay pot is particularly quick, upgrading its movement rate to Bipedal 5/15 (or Hover 5/15 if you also have Hover, or Wall-Slide 5/15 if you have Walls).
      - Walls: your clay pot can "levitate" over walls and ceilings as well as floors.  It exchanges its Hover movement for Wall-Slide movement of the same rate.  (Requires: Hover.)
  - Size: Clay pots are Small.
  - Skills:
      - You may select up to four skills, and your clay pot receives 20 ranks in each.

### Cougar

These big cats are flexible predators, able to persist from the snowy
north to the humid south. They are solitary and territorial. They
usually hunt by ambush. Though dangerous, they can be backed off of prey
by other large predators.

  - Movement: Quadruped 4/12, Climbing 4/12

  - Senses: Normal, Scent

  - Tags: Animal, Cougar, Natural, Wild Companion

  - Rake: Like many cats, cougars will attempt to grip prey with their
    front paws and bite, and then disembowel it with their back legs. If
    a cougar hits with its bite or claws and scores an exceptional
    success, it grapples the target. If a cougar starts its turn
    grappling its prey, it can *disembowel* as a standard action,
    dealing 2D10+6 (2D10+2+DB) damage.

### Dancing Hawk

Dancing Hawks are creatures native to the Dragons' Mountains, the low range that takes up the southeastern half of the Dragonshire; these massive creatures are sometimes used as mounts by Drakes.
They are named for the unique "stomp" that they use to attack prey.

Like a number of species native the the Dragons' Mountains — including dragons themselves — the Dancing Hawk is something between a bird and a reptile.
They are shaped somewhat like a large bird, save that they have jaws (with teeth) rather than a beak; a long, strong, flexible tail that they use for balance and control while running; and their wings are tiny and folded before and under them, like small, awkward arms.
They cannot fly, instead using their tiny wings for display, and for some other social behavior.
They are, however, adept runners, and they run powerfully and surely through the hills and low peaks of the Drake's Mountains; their legs are massively muscled, able to carry their own weight comfortably, and a Drake rider beside.
Most of their bodies are covered in fine, brown feathers, save their legs (which are scaled, like a bird's), and their small arms and long tails (which are covered in long, white feathers with black tips); the same long feathers sprout from the back of the Dancing Hawk's head.
Dancing Hawks are huge, often the height of a drake at their hip, three times as long from nose to tail, and heavy as a small chunk of masonry.

Dancing Hawks are omnivorous; they prefer the fruits and leaves of several trees native to the Dragons' Mountains, as well as some of the hardier shrubs and grasses that grow further up the slope.
They also hunt, though they only hunt animals much smaller than themselves; unfortunately for the shepherds of the hills below the Dragons' Mountains, a sheep is "much smaller than" these massive creatures.
Dancing Hawks have a unique method of hunting; their jaws are not powerful enough to kill, and their claws are wide, short, thick and well-muscled — and without claw or talon, adapted as they are for agility in the rough mountains rather than gripping or slashing.
Instead, they "stomp" on their pray, raising their legs and striking down with immense force; given the size and strength of the creature, these stomps are devastating.

Dancing Hawks are social creatures, travelling in small packs in the Dragons' Mountains.
A typical pack consists of about 6 adults and their young.
They are also intelligent animals — smart enough to share kills and to cooperate to raise their pack's young.

Dancing Hawks run with their spines parallel to the ground; this, taken together with their social and intelligent nature, makes it possible for them to bear a rider.
Though most of them still run wild in the hills and mountains of the Dragons' Mountains, there are several domesticated breeds; they have the size and strength to bear a Drake rider, and the intelligence to be trained for war.
Two factors prevent them from being used ubiquitously as mounts; their clutches, range and populations are small, and they do not have a horse's endurance.
Still, some Drakes do use these powerful creatures as war-mounts, and their stomps are devastating attacks against downed foes.

  - Mountain's Hide: these animals have a thick, touch hide, and their layer of thick, short feathers insulates them from the cold.  They have +1 Armor, and they gain a +10 bonus to checks to endure cold environments or thin air.

  - Low Endurance: however, these animals typically dwell within small ranges.  They are unused to traveling for long periods of time over long distances, and so they take a -10 penalty on checks related to fatigue.

### Frozen Horror

Created when several powerful spirits colluded with a mortal to release
one of the Dead, without binding it — and with some other string attached.

### Horse

These quadrupedal creatures are native to the southwest of the Emerald Plane.
They have long been ridden as mounts — and bred for the purpose — by the cultures there, and have since spread east throughout the Emerald Plane.

### Kambi

These small, furred, yapping creatures have a rudimentary intelligence;
they tend to live in simple, hierarchal social groups, and can build
simple “languages” with as many as 100 sounds and concepts. Attempts to
integrate them into Commonwealth society have failed; they are usually
managed as pests, and occasionally kept as pets.

Background may need tweaking; I want this to be funny, not dark.

  - Movement: Walking 4/12

  - Tags: Humanoid, Kambi, Wild Companion

  - Mindlessly Brave: Kambis have almost no instinct for
    self-preservation. On the plus side, this means that it is almost
    impossible to frighten them; on the minus side, this means that
    Kambis can fail to avoid even obvious hazards, blithely walking into
    danger and destruction.
    
      - Kambis automatically pass tests to resist fear.
      - Kambis have the Oblivious trait. Work on this.

  - Trainable: Kambis have a basic ability to learn and to use tools.
    
      - Kambis can have up to 30 ranks in skills, in addition to those
        listed here.
      - “Wild” Kambi societies will typically be trained in combat
        skills.
      - “Domesticated” Kambis can be trained in diverse skills. (10
        points in a language is recommended.)

  - Almost Social: Kambis can be influenced by either Handle Animal or
    Persuasion.

  - Size: Kambis are Small.

  - Skills:
    
      - *Chase* 50
      - Cooking 40
      - Fray 40
      - Intimidate 30
      - Perception 40
      - Stealth 40
      - One Melee skill at 50

  - Items:
    
      - “wild” Kambis will have simple armor (1 Armor) and a simple
        weapon (a knife, “sword” or spear).

### Pack Cat

These unusual creatures are distant relatives of other big cats, particularly mountain lions.
At first glance they look something like a white-furred mountain lion, although there are subtle differences; they are slightly smaller and leaner, they have a narrower stance, and their legs are slightly longer — with their front legs being slightly higher than their back legs.
Their muzzles are also slightly longer and narrower than other cats, giving their heads a slightly different profile.

Perhaps the most important difference between *pack-cats* and other cats, however, is their social nature; they live in large packs, ranging from 10 to 20, and demonstrate complex social heirarchies, and cooperate socially to accomplish most tasks.
They are hunters and scavengers, and will work as a pack to brind down large pray, to defend kills, and to drive over large predators away from kills.
They also participate in social rearing, cooperating to raise the pack's young.

The cultures of the snowy north have long-since domesticated these creatures; they are kept as pets, work-animals, hunters and war-animals.
They are particularly common in Orcish communities, where some breeds have very long histories with certain communities or clans.

### Raccoon

These small, intelligent omnivores have dexterous hands and a highly
developed sense of touch; they can be very difficult to manage, as they
can open bottles, jars, doors and simple locks. Though they can live in
many environments, they prefer those that afford them trees to hide in,
and streams where they can forage for (and wash) food.

  - Acute Touch: Touch is a raccoon’s dominant sense, and they can
    perceive and manipulate small objects by touch alone; they can even
    defeat simple locks purely by touch, without needing to see them.
    Raccoons receive a +20 bonus to Perception tests involving touch.

### Raptor

At first glance, these large, heavily-feathered predators might appear
to be birds. Their large, clawed, three-fingered hands might appear to
be wings, and can allow the creature to glide for short distances; their
large, powerful legs allow them to sprint and pounce; each foot has a
large, sickle-shaped claw on one toe, allowing them to grip and restrain
prey; and their long, articulated tails provide stability while
sprinting, leaping and gliding.

Raptors are common on *the Southern continent,* where there are many
different species present, fitting a variety of different sizes, diets
and behaviors; some are larger, and hunt mainly by pouncing and pinning
live pray, while others are smaller, can fly, and hunt small animals and
insects. The one presented here is a medium-sized creature known as a
*get Acier to give us a name*; they operate in small packs, and hunt
smaller prey by pursuit or ambush.

### Stilt-Raccoon

*Stilt-Raccoons* are raccoon-like creatures that live along the river-banks and in the marshy lowlands in the Kingdom of Tenna, in the Eastern Kingdoms.
They have long, slender legs, with which they wade through the shallow waters of marshes, river-banks and lake shores.
They are omnivorous, feeding on small fish, some insects,  muscles and clams, and a wide variety of plants and roots.
Much like raccoons, they have an extremely acute sense of touch, which they use to forage for roots, muscles and clams in soft sands.
They are also known as "spearfishers" in the Kingdoms of Men, after the quick striking motions they make when they plunge a forearm into shallow water to strike a fish or frog.

Even though they aren't predators — and despite being more than a little cute — stilt-raccoons are difficult to keep as pets.
They're fairly docile, and they aren't aggressive as long as they're treated well — but they need access to a large body of water, or their health will deteriorate.

The Story of Reckless Prince Eta is popular children's story in the Kingdom of Tenna; it began more than five hundred years ago as a satire of an actual noble of the Tenna clan, but morphed into a parable for children.
It tells the story of a reckless prince who thought himself infinitely wise and strong, and believed no harm could befall him; ultimately, he swam too near a stilt-raccoon, which speared into the water with its forearm and stuck him.
Darker and more didactic versions of the story have the prince being struck in the back of the head, which stuns him and causes him to drown; bawdier and more comic versions of the story place the blow elsewhere.

#### Features

- **Glare-Resistant**: stilt-raccoons are resistant to the effects of glare, the better to hunt fish, frogs and other small animals beneath the surface of lakes and streams.
- **Wader**: stilt-raccoons are well-adapted to wading, and are not slowed when moving through shallow water with quadruped movement.
  They also make little sound while doing so, so they do not take penalties to Stealth checks related to being quiet the way most creatures would.
- **Camouflage**: stilt-raccoons have a dark coat, which helps them to hide in darkness and shadow; this gives them a +10 bonus to Stealth checks in dark areas.

  - Frenetic: Weasels are manic hunters; the scent of blood can send them into a frenzy, in which they attack wildly and can kill much more prey than they will eat.
      - If a weasel inflicts a wound, it enters a Frenzy
      - While in a frenzy, they are immune to fear, and can negate one Wound and one Trauma; also,
      - they attack convulsively, attacking anything they might consider prey.
      - Frenzies last for WIL&div;5 minutes.
      - **Special**: if a weasel is taken as a familiar, then its master is also affected by its Frenzy.  The master may attempt to restrain themselves from attack with a WIL&times;3 check, and attempt to end the weasel's frenzy early with a WIL&times;2 check.
  - Size: Weasels are small creatures, some little larger than mice.  They are Tiny.
