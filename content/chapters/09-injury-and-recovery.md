title: "Injury and Recovery"
---

## Physical Injury

We use the same rules for taking damage, regardless of if the damage is
inflicted by a weapon attack, a disease, a magical ability, or something
else.

Characters who are injured receive Damage, in an amount given by the
source's Damage Value (DV). (If you are attacked by a weapon, this would
be the weapon's DV, for example.) When the amount of damage that you
have taken equals your DUR, you are disabled; you are too badly injured
to take action, and likely unconscious. When the amount of damage that
you have taken reaches your Death Rating (DR), your character has been
killed.

Any time you take damage, you might also suffer *wounds*. If the amount
of damage you take at one time exceeds your Wound Threshold, then one
wound is inflicted. If you take damage that equals or exceeds twice your
Wound Threshold, you take two wounds, and so on; so, if your DUR was 30
and your WT was 6, and you then took 15 damage, you would also take 2
wounds.

When a wound is inflicted, you must roll SOM×3; penalties from wounds
and traumas apply, including the wound that caused the check. If you
fail, you are knocked down.

For every wound that has been inflicted, you suffer a -10 penalty to all
actions (not just physical actions, since wounds are painful and
distracting). Specific wounds might inflict other effects, as determined
by the GM; a wound to the head might render you unconscious, for
example.

Sometimes, you will have the ability to *Negate* a wound. When this
happens, you may ignore the -10 penalty inflicted by that one wound.
Note that the wound is not healed, you are simply not hindered by it.
Only the -10 penalty is negated, any other effects persist; you cannot,
for example, *negate* having your hand chopped off in order to wield a
two-handed weapon.

## Mental Stress

Mental stress works much like physical damage. Difficult circumstances
can inflict *stress *according to their Stress Value (SV); when your
stress exceeds your Lucidity (LUC), your character succumbs to the
enormous strains they are under; they cannot act until their Stress is
lowered below their Lucidity. If your stress exceeds your Insanity
Rating (IR), your character is irreparably traumatized (they are removed
from the game as surely as if they had died).

If you receive stress at one time that exceeds you Trauma Threshold
(TT), you suffer a Trauma. (Like wounds, you can receive multiple
Traumas at a time, if you receive enough Stress at one time to exceed a
multiple of your Trauma Threshold.) Like Wounds, you suffer a -10
penalty to all actions for each Trauma that you have. When you receive a
Trauma, you must roll WIL×3 or be stunned for one round (penalties from
your wounds and traumas apply, including the on that caused the test).

Unlike physical damage, stress can be resisted. Whenever a character
takes stress, they may be permitted to roll a WIL×3 check to *resist*
it: if they succeed, then they do not take Stress; if they fail, they
take the given Stress value. Some sources of stress have two Stress
Values, one that is taken if the WIL×3 check is failed (like normal),
and one (usually lesser) Stress Value that is inflicted *even if the
check is passed*.

Like wounds, the GM may sometimes decide that a Trauma has a specific
effect on a character – such as the overpower urge to avoid the source
of Stress that caused the Trauma. These effects are generally meant to
be roll-played. These effects generally last until the Trauma itself has
been healed.

Sometimes Traumas can be *negated*. When this occurs, the Trauma is not
healed, the character is simply able to function effectively in spite of
it.

## Healing

  - Characters heal naturally:
    
      - 1 DV per Day. One Wound per week that you do not receive any DV,
        after all DV has been healed.
      - 1 SV per Day. One Trauma per month that you do not receive any
        SV, after all SV has been healed.

  - See also *Fast Healing*, in *Abilities*

  - Binding Wounds: characters can use Medicine to attempt to treat and
    bind wounds.
    
      - This is a Medicine Task Action with a time frame of 10 minutes.
      - Roll Medicine: on a success, recover 1d10 DV, and you *negate
        *one wound
      - (the wound must ultimately heal naturally)
      - This check may only be attempted once per wound.

  - Long-Term Care
    
      - A character who rests and receives care heals more quickly.
      - Instead of their natural healing, for each day a character
        spends resting and recovering, they recover 3 DV; they heal one
        wound every 4 days, after all damage has been healed.
      - Likewise, a character who spends time resting and processing
        their traumas recovers more quickly.
      - Instead of their natural healing, they heal 3 SV per day. They
        heal one Trauma in one week, after all stress has been healed.
      - Long-Term Care could provide physical care, mental care or both.
        A character convalescing at a peaceful temple could receive both
        physical and mental care at the same time, for example.

  - Some Powers and Items also provide physical or mental healing; each
    Item or Power will have its own rules for doing
so.

## Conditions, Potions, Poisons and Diseases

### conditions

  - I’m not sure if I actually need rules for this; I want to keep the
    number of “rules and systems” to the minimum necessary. And if I add
    rules for conditions, then everything that could be a condition
    should be—and I don’t want to commit to that.

  - Conditions have *effects* that persist while the condition applies
    to you, and rules for *removing* the condition it (which might be as
    simple as a *duration, *after which the condition ends).

  - Bleeding:
    
      - effects:
        
          - 1 DV every minute.
          - Bleeding characters are easy to follow; pursuers gain a +20
            bonus on Search and Perception checks.
    
      - end:
        
          - successful First Aid check, as a 1 minute Task Action

### Potions and Poisons

  - Both are chemicals that affect characters.

  - Both have *effects* which persists for the potion or poison’s
    *duration*.

  - They may have an *onset time* before the effects occur, and they may
    allow *resistance checks* to partially resist the potion’s effects.

  - Potions:
    
      - are usually beneficial, and
      - are usually drunk (you can retrieve and drink a potion as a
        Quick Action).

  - Poisons:
    
      - are usually harmful, and
    
      - are often either added to food or drink, or are coated on
        weapons.
    
      - If a poison is coated on a weapon, then, on the first attack
        that causes a wound,
        
          - the wounded target is effected by the poison, and
          - the poison on the weapon is consumed
          - (traces may linger, so handling the weapon may be dangerous,
            and the poison may still be detectable if the weapon is
            examined).

  - For sample Potions and Poisons, see the *Items* section.

### Diseases

  - Diseases have an *resistance check*, and *onset time,* a *duration,
    effects* and possibly *treatment*.

  - Some diseases may have effects based on how long the character has
    been infected—that is, the effects may proceed through *stages*.

  - When a character is first exposed to a disease, they make their
    *resistance check*; if they succeed, then they have not been
    infected.

  - If infected, once the *onset time* has passed, the symptoms of the
    disease manifest; at this point, the *effects* of the disease apply.

  - The symptoms then last for the *duration*; once this has passed, the
    disease and its effects end.

  - Finally, some diseases have a specific *treatment*. The effects of
    treatment vary, ranging from curing the disease entirely, to
    allowing an additional Resistance check, to shortening the duration.
    
      - Of course, some powers, potions and means magical and medical
        can also be used to cure diseases.

  - Characters can be deliberately exposed to disease: weapons can be
    coated with the blood and viscera of the infected, food can be made
    from tainted meat, and the infected can choose to enter and mingle
    among a population to spread their disease, for example.

  - Flu
    
      - Resistance: DUR × 2
      - Onset: 1 Day
      - Duration: 3 Days
      - Effects: fatigue, aches and nausia

  - Black Death
    
      - Resistance: DUR
      - Onset: 3 Days
      - Duration: 1 week
      - Effect: high fever, delerium, unconsciousness; 1d10 DV / day

  - Raking Cough
    
      - Resistance: DUR × 2
    
      - Onset: 1 Month
    
      - Duration: permanent
    
      - Effect: Sever cough, especially after exertion. Loss of stamina.
        
          - Raking Cough progresses: characters suffer -5 DUR / month.
            When characters reach their DUR, they die.
