## Languages

  - The Commonwealth is wide and diverse, including countless small
    regional cultures; it includes a rich multitude of languages.
    
      - Languages tend to correspond to *cultures* rather than *races,*
        and cultures tend to be regional: a given wood elf is likely to
        speak a language that is similar to (and influenced by) the
        other nearby cultures with (whom they have regular contact), and
        that language is likely to be totally dissimilar to the language
        spoken by another wood elf living a thousand miles away (with
        whom they have almost no contact).
      - Note that, before the internet, before the railroad, in the
        early days of the printing press, languages tended to be small
        and local, and they tended to be relatively fluid.

  - Things are complicated by the fact that many races cannot make the
    same sounds as one-another.
    
      - For example, Gnolls and Humans cannot physically make the same
        sounds, and so they cannot speak one-another’s languages.
      - It is common for people in mixed communities to have some
        fluency in their neighbor’s languages—even if they cannot
        actually *speak* that language.

Language Rules

  - Creatures can have one, two or three dots in a language.
    
      - If they have one dot in a language, they have a basic ability to
        speak it; they can understand and communicate basic concepts,
        and can make themselves understood with some effort.
      - If they have two dots in a language, they have conversational
        fluency; they can comfortably hold a conversation in that
        language, although they may have an accent, be missing some
        uncommon vocabulary or occasionally mangle an idiom.
      - If they have three dots in a language, they have native fluency;
        either they are native speakers, or they have mastered the
        language to an equivalent degree.

  - Any given creature can only speak certain languages (except some
    particularly gifted mimics).
    
      - Each creature (that can speak) has one or more *language
        groups*; these represent the sounds that they can make.
      - Each language also has one (or more, in rare cases) language
        group, representing the sounds that are required in order to
        speak it.
      - A character can learn (that is, purchase dots for) any language,
        and
      - a character can read, write and understand any language that
        they have dots in, but
      - they can only (physically) speak a language that they have the
        languages groups for.
      - See also the *Torque of Speaking* in Magic Items.

  - Sometimes, communicating is difficult;
    
      - this can be the situation if you are trying to understand a
        language that is different than but *mutually intelligible* with
        your own, or it might be because your character lacks native
        proficiency in a given language. In these cases, you can use an
        INT×3 check to see if your character can communicate
        effectively.
      - Note that checks are usually only appropriate when it is
        important to communicate a complex concept, and when limited
        time is available to communicate. In cases where characters have
        time to talk with one another, you may assume that any
        reasonable concept can eventually be communicated.

Common Language Groups

  - HHED: the sounds that humans, halflings, elves and dwarves can make
  - GR: the sounds that Gnolls and Ratfolk can make (commonly described
    as “several coyotes having seizures”)
  - DDK: the sounds that Dragons, Drakes and Kobolds can make (commonly
    described as “a rasping song-bird”)

Example Languages, Rare and Common:

  - Commonwealth Standard
    
      - Group: Any
    
      - Commonwealth Standard represents a partially-successful attempt
        at a universal language.
    
      - When speaking, Commonwealth Standard uses a small set of
        abstract sounds, designed to be very distinct. For each abstract
        sound, each speaker picks one sound that they can make and
        substitutes it.
    
      - This at best kind-of works; it is difficult to speak and
        understand Commonwealth Standard, since any given speaker might
        use different substitute sounds than any other.
    
      - However, as a *written *language, Commonwealth Standard is a
        huge success.
    
      - Commonwealth Standard is the almost-universal written language
        for governing documents, contracts, trade and scholarship—even
        in the Kingdoms of Man, most merchants, administrators and
        elites can read and write Commonwealth Standard.
    
      - Most formal education uses texts in Commonwealth Standard;
        because of this, more people can read and write in Commonwealth
        Standard than in their own language.
    
      - Names in Commonwealth Standard tend to be combinations of words,
        so that they can be translated.
        
          - A Human telling a Kobold that their name is “Anden” is
            pointless if the Kobold cannot make any of those sounds.
            “Quicksmith” is at least translatable.
    
      - Commonwealth often forms new words by combining existing words
        together:
        
          - the word that we are translating as “Plane,” for example,
            consists of the words “Great” and “Land” combined together.
    
      - Note that almost no-one has Commonwealth Standard as their
        native language; that’s almost always a regional or cultural
        language. However, some ability to speak Commonwealth Standard
        as a second language is common.

  - Chatter: the language of the Warren Isles.
    
      - Chatter, as it has been not-entirely-kindly named, is the
        indigenous language of the Ratfolk of the Warren Isles.
      - Chatter is not commonly spoken in the Commonwealth; most of the
        Commonwealth’s Ratfolk now speak Cqik.
      - This in turn has meant that Chatter has become one of the common
        languages of crime in the Haven Isles—as the language is only
        commonly spoken by the Ratfolk of the Shaded Sea Peoples and
        their criminal and piratical allies.

  - Cqik: the language of the Commonwealth’s Ratfolk
    
      - The name “Cqik” is derived from a somewhat famous—or
        infamous—letter that was written by a Kingdoms-of-Men diplomat
        visiting the Haven Isles; she attempted to describe what she
        thought a Ratfolk merchant sounded like, and “Cqik” is a
        transliteration from her Royal to Islander. The name is widely
        pronounced “kweek” (although some Ratfolk put visitors through
        something of an initiation by writing out “Cqik” in the Islander
        alphabet—which is almost the same as Weal’s—and cajoling them
        into trying to pronounce it).
      - Though Cqik is commonly spoken by Ratfolk living among the
        Commonwealth, it actually inherits more from Heartland Gnoll
        than from Chatter. When Ratfolk refugees settled in the Haven
        Isles, many of them learned Gnollish as a second language; the
        language of the much larger gnollish population eventually
        supplanted much of the Chatter that the Ratfolk had carried with
        them.

  - Heartland Gnoll: a language commonly spoken by Gnolls in Heartland
    Province.
    
      - Heartland Gnoll is a derivative of the language spoke by the
        Gnoll tribe that helped found the Commonwealth. As that tribe’s
        fortunes grew, as they founded new cities and towns and became a
        people, they spread their language and cemented its place as the
        language peace and prosperity among those spoken by Gnolls.
      - Over centuries of close contact, Heartland Gnoll has absorbed
        many idioms from Weal.
      - Though Heartland Gnoll is far and away the most common Gnollish
        language, many other tribal languages still survive.
      - Group GR

  - Hel: common language in Northland, influenced by both Hud and Weal.
    
      - Hel is a language that has sprung up in Northland province,
        combing bits of both Weal (as spoken by the humans and halflings
        among the early Commonwealth settlers) and Hud (an older Dwarven
        language spoken by most of the Dwarven clans).
      - Though originally regarded as something of a vulgar language, it
        has since become ubiquitous in Northland province; many today
        view the unique, common language of their thinly-populated
        province with pride.
      - Group HHED

  - High Kobold: language used by Kobolds in the Commonwealth.
    
      - High Kobold is derived from Old Kobold, but has become far more
        complex. It has imported many words directly from Rak, and has
        borrowed idioms from Weal and, more recently, Islander Elvish.
      - High Kobold has grown to include countless neologisms—new words
        for things that Kobolds never encountered as an oppressed and
        impoverished population in the Kingdoms of Men.
      - Many kobolds find it somewhat amusing that some of the
        birdsong-like sounds they use strike other races as musical; as
        a result, High Kobold has come to include some idioms selected
        specifically for their lyrical quality.
      - Group DDK

  - Hud: a traditional Dwarven language, common in Northland Province.
    
      - Hud is an older Dwarven language, dating back more than a
        thousand years.
      - Though Hud is still a widely-known language, it is not widely
        used for conversation; most Dwarven clans have their own
        idiomatic languages, influenced by their history and neighbors
        (though many are mutually intelligible with Hud, to a greater or
        lesser extent).
      - Hud is mainly used as a formal language, for interaction between
        clans (whose languages might not be mutually intelligible with
        each other), and for liturgy and ritual (which might be
        ancient).
      - Group HHED

  - Islander Elvish: commonly spoken by the Ash Elves living on Haven
    Isle
    
      - Islander Elvish is a complex hybrid language, derived from the
        many languages carried to the Haven Isles by wood and shade
        elves and heavily influenced by Weal (as spoken by human and
        halfling settlers) and even Hel (as spoken by the dwarven
        settlements in Islandholme).
      - Group HHED

  - Islander: common language on the Haven Isles, influenced by Islander
    Elvish and Weal.
    
      - Islander is a language commonly spoken on the Haven Isles; it is
        a derivative of Weal, though it has borrowed heavily from the
        disordered synthesis of elven languages that is Islander Elven.
      - Group HHED

  - Keillou: the language of the Shade Elves.
    
      - Keillou is a common language spoken throughout Shade Elven
        territory. It is primarily the language of the Shade Elves, but
        it has also been adopted by many of their tributaries.
      - The Shaded Sea Peoples—the Shade Elves, the Ratfolk of the
        Warren Isles and the Leapers—cannot share a language with
        one-another, and the shade elves are not inclined to learn the
        languages of their tributaries, so Keillou has had few foreign
        influences.
      - The Shade Elves themselves primarily speak a few specific
        dialects of Keillou; in turn, something of a vulgar keillou has
        sprung up, which has been influenced by the languages of some of
        the shade elves’ tributaries.

  - Rak: a language spoken by Dragons and Drakes in the Dragonshire
    
      - Dragons have never had a large population, and they can speak
        with few other languages—kobolds were the only race commonly
        found on the Emerald Plane that could make the same sounds that
        they could. Rak was long an ancient, unique language that
        Dragons used only to communicate among themselves.
      - Though dragons are small in number, they are also extremely
        long-lived; this means that each individual dragon would
        frequently accumulate a library of unique idioms, quirks and
        turns-of-phrase. At one time, there were as many dialects of Rak
        as there were dragons.
      - All of this changed with the founding of the Dragonshire, with
        Karrach’s call for other dragons to settle in the Dragonshire
        and especially with the creation of the Drakes.
      - Rak became the common language of the Dragonshire’s nobility—of
        the dragons that led the nation as monarchs and the Drakes who
        served as their nobles and administrators.
      - Over years in common usage, it has become more regular—and, as
        it was used as a written language of formal contract by the
        merchants of the Dragonshire, it has become somewhat more
        formal.
      - Rak is still widely spoken by the drakes and dragons of the
        Dragonshire.
      - Group DDK

  - Royal: a common language in the Kingdoms of Men.
    
      - Royal is derived from Old Imperial, though it has been
        dramatically altered by the intervening thousand years of
        history.
      - Royal has been somewhat resistant to influences from other
        languages, in part because such borrowlings are viewed dimly by
        some in Kingdoms, especially in the eastern Kingdoms
        (unsurprisingly). This also means that there are noticeable
        differences between regional dialects, especially between the
        eastern and western Kingdoms.
      - Group HHED

  - Vulgar Goblin: a language used by the lower ranks of the Goblin
    Kingdom.
    
      - Goblins can produce a wide array of sounds, and their languages
        typically employ all of them; this makes it a practical
        impossibility for members of most other races to speak a goblin
        language.
      - Vulgar Goblin is a clipped and fluid dialect of an older
        Goblinoid language, used by the lower ranks of the Goblin
        Kingdom.
      - It has been influenced by the languages of the peoples that
        goblins took as slaves—by the languages of humans, elves and
        gnolls, among others.
      - It is distinct from Royal Goblin, the language of the Goblin
        kings; this language has resisted influences from those taken as
        slaves, but has in turn been influenced by the structure of
        Commonwealth Standard.
      - Group HHED, GR

  - Weal: a common language in Heartland Province.
    
      - Weal is a widely heterogeneous language. It is derived from Old
        Imperial, the language of the humans who built the Empire, but
        it has since been heavily influenced by the many languages that
        the Commonwealth has encountered and peacefully absorbed as it
        spread across the Emerald Plane.
      - Weal—or some regional dialect thereof—is commonly spoken
        throughout Heartland and Westward Provinces.
      - Notably, Weal was carried throughout the Emerald Plane by early
        Commonwealth settlers, and has itself become the root from which
        several other, newer languages where derived; it is still
        mutually-intelligible with some of them, like Hel.
      - Group HHED

  - Old Imperial: the language that the Empire carried west.
    
      - Old Imperial was the language of the Empire, carried West from
        the coast towards the World’s-Spine Mountains by imperial
        settlers.
      - In the millennium since those days, Old Imperial has died out;
        while some scholars of the ancient past can still understand it,
        it is all but gone as a living language.
      - Both Weal and Royal are descended from it, although they are
        very different languages from it and from one another—Weal in
        particular is greatly changed from Old Imperial.
      - Old Imperial is notable for its aspirated H’s and hard
        consonants.
      - Group HHED

  - Old Kobold: the original Kobold language, spoken in their ancestral
    home in Imperial territory.
    
      - Old Kobold was spoken by the Kobold populations that resided
        within the Kingdoms of Men.
      - Old Kobold passed away with the near-extinction of the
        populations that spoke it.
      - Some Kobold populations still survive in the western portion of
        the Kingdoms; Old Kobold can still be heard there.
