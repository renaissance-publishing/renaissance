## Wealth and Bartering

  - You have a wealth level, between 0 and 5.
    
      - At your highest level, you have 3 dots; at each lower level, you
        have 4.
      - ...unless you are wealth level 0, of course, in which case you
        have no (dots of) wealth at all.

  - Items have a cost category, from 1 to 5.
    
      - 1 is Trivial, 2 is Minor, 3 is Moderate, 4 is High, 5 is Extreme
      - (Not all items have costs; you don’t have to pay to pick up a
        stick.)

  - When you want to purchase something:
    
      - You might need to roll a Barter check, to determine if you and
        the merchant can reach a deal; consult the table below to see if
        a check is required, and if it has a modifier.
      - If you succeed, the merchant is willing to sell you the item,
        and you can pay for it without affecting your net wealth; you
        receive the item, and you don’t deplete a dot.
      - If you fail, the merchant is willing to sell you the item, but
        they drive a hard bargain; you can choose to either deplete a
        dot and receive the item, or to go without (you don’t deplete a
        dot and don’t get the item).
      - If you score an exceptional failure, then you can’t reach a deal
        with the merchant; maybe their stock is low, or you don’t have
        something they want, or they decide they don’t like you.

  - Sidebar: Paying Up Front
    
      - If you don’t want to try to barter for an item—or if your
        character isn’t particularly good at bartering—the GM may allow
        you to skip the barter check and simply deplete a dot of wealth.
      - Some items may not be available without bartering.

  - Sidebar: Holding Back
    
      - Sometimes, you might want to conceal the full extent of your
        financial resources; we call this *holding back*.
      - When holding back, you can choose to use a lower wealth level
        than your highest one.
      - You have to have an available dot at the level that you choose
        to use, and if you deplete a dot, you must deplete a dot at that
        level.

  - A depleted dot isn’t gone, it’s just tapped out; you’ve used the
    liquid part of those assets.
    
      - You can restore a depleted dot during down-time, see below.

  - Wealth level is selected during character creation, see *Character
    *Creation for rules.

|                                              |                   |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Item Cost vs. Wealth Level                   | Barter Test       |
| Item cost is more than 1 less than wealth    | Automatic success |
| Item cost is 1 less than wealth level        | \+20 bonus        |
| Item cost is the same as wealth level        | No modifier       |
| Item cost is 1 higher than wealth level      | \-20 penalty      |
| Item cost is more than 1 greater than wealth | Automatic failure |
| You are wealth level 0                       | You can’t barter  |

## Changing your Wealth Level

  - You can change your wealth level during down-time. However, this is
    very difficult to do.
  - You may proceed from one wealth level to the next, one at a time,
    using the following checks.

|                   |                                   |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------- |
| 1 (peasant)       | 3 months, profession check at +10 |
| 2 (local artisan) | 6 months, Profession check        |
| 3 (merchant)      | 1 year, Profession check          |
| 4 (local wealthy) | 2 years, Profession check at -20  |
| 5 (noble)         | 5 years, Profession check at -30  |

## Income, Investments and Lifestyles

  - You can work for income during down-time.
    
      - Working for income is a 20-shift job; you must have at least 10
        ranks in a profession, but no check is required.
        
          - Let’s not require a profession check, because it’s tedious
            and because the failure case is irritating to handle (your
            character abruptly gets 0 income?).
    
      - If you succeed, you either restore a depleted dot of wealth at
        your highest level, or two lower-level dots.

  - Your character lives a certain lifestyle, which incurs expenses.
    
      - Lifestyles have levels from 0 to 5, just like wealth; see the
        table below for descriptions.
      - At the beginning of each month, pick a lifestyle for that month,
        and deplete a dot of the same level to pay for it.

  - Your character can put their wealth to work producing more wealth.
    
      - Investments represent planted fields, investments in businesses,
        traveling trade caravans and so on.
    
      - They aren’t liquid assets, so you can’t spend them.
    
      - Investments have a level from 1 to 5.
    
      - You can convert a dot of wealth into an investment; you loose
        the dot, but you gain an investment at the specified level.
        
          - Converting a dot of wealth to an investment is a 5 shift job
            and requires a successful Barter, Profession: Investor or
            similar check.
    
      - Every month, your investments generate wealth.
        
          - At the end of every month, for each investment that you
            have, you may refresh one dot of wealth of the same level.
    
      - You can liquidate an investment, converting it back into a dot
        of wealth; this is a 5 shift job and requires a successful
        Barter, Profession: Investor or similar check.
    
      - Investments can be handled in the abstract, but some players may
        wish to detail exactly what their character’s holdings and
        investments look
like.

| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0 (begger)      | You live of what you can beg, steal or scrounge, dwelling in alleys, woods and caves.                         |
| 1 (poor)        | You live a humble life, with long hours of work and no luxuries.                                              |
| 2               | Though poor, you have accrued more wealth than those around you, giving you access to a few greater luxuries. |
| 3 (comfortable) | You                                                                                                           |
| 4 (wealthy)     |                                                                                                               |
| 5 (noble)       |                                                                                                               |
