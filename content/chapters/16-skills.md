## Types of Skill

  - Many skills describe a unique task, like Riding or Stealth, describe
    some discrete skill that you either have some degree of experience
    in or you do not.
    
      - For these skills, you simply purchase ranks for them (or get
        them from your background, or possibly from some other source).
      - Your target number is then your ranks in the skill, plus your
        score in the linked aptitude, plus any modifiers that apply (as
        in the Tests section).
      - Stealth and Perception are examples of these kinds of skills.

  - Sometimes, a task can be broken into fields. The process of
    mastering one field is similar to the process of mastering another,
    but the specific things that you learn to do are different.
    
      - For example, blacksmiths and cobblers have two very different
        skill-sets, but both are *professions*.
      - In these cases, we use *field skills*.
      - You can’t take ranks in a field skill directly; rather, you have
        to also pick a *field*. The combination of the field skill and a
        specific field produces a single skill. For example, you can’t
        take ranks in *Art*, but you can take ranks in *Art: Sculpture*.
      - You can take the same field skill more than once, as long as you
        pick a different field each time. For example, you can take
        ranks in *Art: Painting* and *Art: Sculpture*, and you would
        treat the two as two entirely separate skills in every way.
      - Each field skill will include a list of sample fields. You don’t
        have to pick one of the samples, but if you don’t, you should
        get your GM’s permission. You should also make sure that you and
        your GM both agree on when your field skill applies and when it
        doesn’t. And, obviously, your field shouldn’t be much broader or
        much narrower than the samples are.
      - You can specialize in a field skill the same way you could a
        normal skill. For example, you could have the *Art: Painting
        \[Landscapes\]* skill.

  - Sometimes, the same set of skills can apply to several different
    sup-disciplines, with only slight modifications; an athlete might be
    able to learn a new sport fairly easily, for example, or an
    experienced sword-fighter might be able to use a mace ably without
    ever having trained with it before.
    
      - In these cases, we use *Proficiency Skills*.
      - Each proficiency skill that you have ranks in will have an
        associated list of *proficiencies*.
      - When you use a proficiency skill, see if you have a proficiency
        appropriate to the task: if you do, roll the proficiency skill
        as normal; if you don’t, roll your proficiency skill at a -20
        penalty.
      - For example, suppose you have 40 ranks in the Athletics skill,
        and have proficiencies in Acrobatics, Climbing and Freerunning.
        If you want to vault over a low fence and roll to keep your
        momentum, then you would roll you full Athletics skill as
        normal, since your proficiency in Freerunning applies. However,
        if you need to swim across a swiftly-flowing river, you would
        take a -20 penalty, because you don’t have the Swimming
        proficiency.
      - Somewhat like field skills, each proficiency skill will list
        sample proficiencies. When you select a proficiency, you don’t
        have to pick one of the samples, but you should get your GM’s
        permission to use one that you make up yourself.
      - You can specialize in a Proficiency Skill; normally, you would
        do this by picking a particular proficiency to specialize in.
      - Sometimes, no proficiency is required; in these cases, simply
        roll the check as normal, with no penalty.

  - See *character creation* for rules on acquiring ranks in skills,
    specializations, and proficiencies.

## Skill List

<aside class="designnote">

### Crunchy, But Not Mechanical

A good description of Renaissance, provided by an early playtester, is that it is "crunchy but not mechanical"--meaning that it provides players with clear, mathematical rules for manipulating checks, but few descriptive rules for how those checks should be used (what might be called "mechanics" or "systems").

The skill descriptions that follow are an example of this principle;
We describe the kinds of things that are common areas of expertise; later, in *Character Creation*, we'll tell you how to purchase ranks in these skills--which will allow you great control over what exactly your target number will be when you are required to roll a skill check.
But we *don't* tell you *exactly* what each skill can be used to do, or *exactly* what kind of modifiers you're likely to encounter;
that's largely up to the GM and the players.

This is the reverse of some other RPGs, which might tell you specifically what each skill can be used to do, and what checks would be required;
this difference might require some getting used to!

<!--
I'll comment this out for now.  While this text is good, I think it's already present somewhere else.

While we like the flexibility that this gives the system, it does create a problem: some players greatly miss the kind of guidance that those "mechanics" and "systems" provide.
If you have that problem, then, when designing your character, you may want to start by trying to think about the kinds of things you want your character to be able to do--which might mean imagining them in specific scenarios and then thinking about how they sovle the problems they encounter--and then pick skills that represent those tactics and abilities.
When playing your character, you might want to first decide what you want your character to *d0*, and then allow the GM to decide which skill checks are required and what your modifiers are.
(And not that there is not necessarily one correct answer to that question!)

If you're the GM and you're having trouble picking skills, remember that the skill system is *intended* to be open-ended and flexible.
You do want to be consistant and you don't want to be too lax, but you *don't* need to worry too much about picking exactly which skill and exactly which modifier is required in every given situation.
And there's nothing wrong with asking a player which skill they think applies, or giving them a choice of skills--because its entirely possible that they might have more than one applicable skill!

  - Animal Handling (SAV)
    
      - Active, Social
      - Animal Handling is used as the “Social Skill for Animals”. It’s used to coax animals into doing what you would like them to do (to scare them of, for example), or to change their attitude towards you (to earn their trust, for example).
      - Animal Handling can be used to train an animal, but we don’t provide detailed rules for that. This is generally best handled either by purchasing a Class or Power (like Wildlander), or by purchasing the animal companion as a Moderate or Major Item and then building it using the rules for Followers.
      - Sample Specialization: by a family of animals (canines, felines, equines, etc.), or by role (combat, work, companion, riding)
      - Aryn wants to **scare off a mountain lion** that's threatening the group; she rolls her *Animal Handling*, versus the mountain lion's Resist Social Manipulation.
      - The mountain lion has been shadowing the group, so Aryn decides to try to lure it to her and **befriend it**; she rolls her *Animal Handling* again, this time unopposed.
      - Aryn decides to **train** the mountain lion **as a companion**; mountain lions can't normally be domesticated, so this is going to be tricky; the GM decides that this is a 30-shift Job, requiring an Animal Handling test with a -10 penalty.

  - Art (INT, Field Skill)
    
      - Active, Knowledge
      - Sample Fields: Literature, Painting, Sculpture, Theater
      - Specializations: by field
      - River is pretending to be a minstrel, so he decides to spend some time **playing his flute in a bar** for money; this requires an *Art: Music* check.
      - The adventure taps out River's finances, so he finds himself in the embarrassing situation of needing money: he makes a bargain with a tavern owner, a day spent playing for a day's lodging.  This doesn't require a check an *Art: Music* check, since he doesn't need to play particularly stirringly to satisfy the tavern owner; it might require a Protocol check to talk the bartender into accepting the deal, or a Profession: Minstrel check to determine just how much River makes.

  - Athletics (SOM, Proficiency Skill)
    
      - Active, Movement, Physical
      - Represents your characters’ general athletic ability, and the specific list of athletic disciplines that you’re proficient with.
      - Example Proficiencies:
        - **Agility** is used for forms of athleticism that rely on dexterity, grace and precision.  For humanoids, this covers flips, rolls, dives, and the like.  *Agility* is used for most *stunt moves*.
        - **Endurance** is used for forms of athleticism that rely on perseverance.  For humanoids, this covers jogging, distance running, swimming, and the like.
        - **Might** is used when strength is the primary factor.  For humanoids, this covers throwing, pulling, lifting, long jumps, and the like.
        - **Swiftness**, which is used for raw speed.  *Swiftness* is usually used in chases (whether you're tring to *catch* someone or *outrun* them).
        - of by *Specific Sports*
      - Aryn is **chasing a suspect** through the streets of Tern City; this requires opposed Athletics checks, both using the *Swiftness* proficiency.  They both have the *Swiftness* proficiency, so they both roll their Athletics skill (assuming they're both running flat-out); if Aryn wins, she'll gain on him, but if he wins, he'll open the distance.
      - The suspect decides to try to trip Aryn up, so he knocks over a table behind him.  Aryn wants to **vault the table**, so the GM calls for an *Athletics* check using the *Agility* proficiency.  Aryn has the *Agility* proficiency, so she rolls her Athletics without penalty; if she makes it, she'll vault the table.
      - The suspect wants to **climb the wooden facade of a building**.  The GM decides this requires the **Might** proficiency, but the suspect doesn't have it, so he rolls his *Athletics* with a -20 penalty.  If he fails, he will fall.

  - Control (WIL)
    
      - Active, Mental
      - Your ability to manipulate your own natural magical energy.
      - Primarily used with sleights that require tests, or to develop new sleights.
      - Example Specialization: by power

  - Craft (COG, Field Skill)
    
      - Active, Physical, Technical, Trade
      - Used to make things
      - Sample Fields: Carpentry, Chemistry, Clockwork, Glassworking, Leatherworking, Masonry, Smithing

  - Deception (SAV)
    
      - Active, Social
      - Used to deceive people in social situations—to make other
        characters believe what you want them to believe.
      - Can also be used (usually in conjunction with Disguise) to hide
        your identity, and possibly to impersonate someone else.
        (Obviously, impersonating a specific person will be very tricky,
        and might not be possible at all if you don’t have information
        about that person to go on, or are forced to interact with
        people who know that person well.)
      - For minor or simple lies, can be used unopposed.
      - For big lies, important scenes or major characters, your
        Deception is opposed by either the target’s Read or their Resist
        Social Manipulation.
      - Obviously, most people will not believe absurd or outlandish
        lies, regardless of how skillful a liar a character is.
      - Example Specializations: lying, negotiating, impersonation

  - Disable Device (COO)
    
      - Active, Physical, Technical
      - Represents your ability to defeat mechanical devices.
      - Used to pick locks, disable traps and disable magical devices.

  - Disguise (INT)
    
      - Active, Social
      - Disguise is used to physically disguise yourself as someone else.
      - You will often also need to have *Deception* in order to pass yourself off as someone else in a social situation.

  - Exotic Skill (Attribute Varies, Field Skill)
    
      - Exotic, *other tags*
      - Freeform skill, used to handle very unusual cases of other
        skills. Examples:
      - Exotic Culture (SAV, Protocol for very alien cultures)
      - Exotic Knowledge (COG, for esoteric knowledge)
      - Exotic Mount (COO or SAV)
      - Exotic Movement (SOM or COO)
      - Don’t be too eager to resort to Exotic Skills\! You are *almost always* better served by using a normal skill, perhaps with a specialization to indicate your unique background or interest.

  - Fray (COO)
    
      - Active, Combat, Physical
      - Your general-use defense skill, representing your ability to avoid attacks.
      - Can also be used to test your ability to dodge and evade.

  - Intimidate (SAV)
    
      - Active, Combat, Social
      - Used to represent your characters ability to manipulate others
        through menace rather than poise.
      - Usually used opposed, against the target’s *Resist Intimidation* (see *Special Numbers* below).
      - Specialization: by circumstance (interrogation, combat) or by method (physical intimidation, blackmail)

  - Knowledge (COG, Field Skill)
    
      - Passive, Knowledge, Mental, Technical
      - Represents knowledge in some area of interest for your character.
      - Almost anything can be a Knowledge field. When selecting a field, be careful: it shouldn’t be so narrow that it never applies, but it also shouldn’t be so broad that it *always* applies.
      - Example Fields:
        
          - *by interest*: Criminal Gangs, Folklore, Local Religions, Military Tactics, Noble Lines
          - *by academic study*: Anatomy, Astronomy, History, Literature, Magic, Mathematics, Natural Philosophy, Philosophy, Rhetoric, Theology

  - Medicine (COG)
    
      - Active, Knowledge, Physical, Technical
      - Can be used to diagnose and treat injuries, see *Injury and Healing*.
      - Example Specializations: Binding, Long-Term Care, Surgery, *by disease*, *by area*

  - Melee Weapons (SOM, Proficiency Skill)

      - Active, Attack, Combat, Melee Attack, Physical
      - Your skill with one- and two-handed melee weapons.
      - Note that unarmed combat and pole-arms are represented by separate skills (Unarmed Combat and Pole-Arms, respectively).
      - Note that *Shields* is offered as a proficiency.  This proficiency is *not* required to use a shield to defend yourself; rather, it is used for shields that are also designed for use as offensive weapons—such as spiked shields and dueling-shields.
      - *Double-weapons* refers to "D&D-style" double-weapons; the historicity of these weapons is dubious, but there's no reason your character can't have one!
      - Sample Specializations: Axes, Clubs, Daggers, *Double-Weapons*, Hammers, Maces, *Shields*, Staffs, Swords, *by exotic weapon*

  - Perception (INT)
    
      - Active, Mental
      - Used to notice things.
      - Often used to spot sneaking characters (opposed by their Stealth).
      - To search an area for hidden items, use Search.

  - Persuasion (SAV)
    
      - Active, Social
      - Used when attempting to convince a character to go along with something.
      - For minor dealings with an NPC, usually used unopposed. For important tests, or when an NPC is skeptical or requires convincing, oppose with a Resist Social Manipulation check (see below).
      - For social negotiations, use opposed Persuasion (or Protocol) checks.

  - Pole-Arms (SOM, Proficiency Skill)
    
      - Active, Attack, Combat, Melee Attack, Physical
      - Your skill with pole-arms, the mainstays of infantry combat.
      - Sample Specializations: Bladed, Blunt, Spiked, *by exotic weapon*

  - Profession (COG, Field Skill)
    
      - Passive, Technical, Trade
      - Represents your knowledge and experience within a specific skill or trade.
      - Used for checks testing your knowledge about a profession, or for your ability to operate as a professional for a long period of time.
      - Can be used to represent you practice a trade for profit (particularly during down-time).
      - For actually producing an item, see Craft
      - Sample Fields: Brewer, Carpenter, Cobbler, Cook, Doctor, Explorer, Farmer, Mason, Merchant, Painter, Priest, Professor, Sailor, Scholar, Smuggler, Soldier, Thug, Trader

  - Protocol (SAV)
    
      - Passive, Knowledge, Social
      - Used to represent your ability to handle the unwritten rules of
        social interaction, both simple and complex.
      - Can be used to navigate complex social situations, estimate or
        follow social protocols, make a good impression in social
        interaction.
      - Can be used to negotiate, for example in a legal debate or
        hostage negotiation.
      - Can be used to *recover gracefully* after a roll-playing error
        (like saying something that your character would never say).
      - Very exotic, unusual or secretive cultures use the Exotic
        Culture skill.
      - Negotiating prices and trading uses the Barter skill.

  - Ranged Weapons (COO, Proficiency Skill)
    
      - Active, Attack, Combat, Ranged Attack, Physical
      - Your skill with different ranged weapons.
      - This also covers natural attacks that involve a projectile (like acid spit), and it can be used for Indicate Only Attacks (see Combat).
      - This does not cover the use of large, crewed weapons (like cannons or catapults); those would be covered by an *Exotic Skill*.
      - Sample Proficiencies: Bows, Crossbows, *Guns*, Thrown Weapons

  - Read (SAV)
    
      - Active, Social
      - As in, Read Body Language; appraise others’ motives in social situations.
      - Used *unopposed* when used to assess someone’s mood.
      - Used to oppose Deception.

  - Research (COG)
    
      - Active, Knowledge, Mental
      - Primarily covers searching for information in books, collections, museums or libraries.
      - For finding interesting items—including searching for clues—use Search.
      - For drawing conclusions from technical information, use an appropriate Knowledge or Profession skill.

  - Ride (COO)
    
      - Active, Movement, Physical
      - Ride checks represent your skill at riding steeds (and possibly other conveyances, magical and mundane).
      - A character with basic competence (that is, 10 ranks in ride) doesn’t need to make a Ride check for normal movement with a mount: if you know how to ride a horse, you don’t need to make a test to ride to town.
      - Ride is a “movement skill,” commonly used either for difficult maneuvers or for chases (see *Movement Modes*).
      - Can specialize in an individual creature (like Horses) or an individual task (Racing).
      - Very unusual creatures should use the Exotic Mount skill, see the Exotic Skill.

  - Search (INT)
    
      - Active, Physical
      - Used to find interesting, possibly-hidden items (including artifacts at a ruin, evidence at a crime scene, or a secret door hidden in a library).
      - Can also be used to search someone for concealed items (opposed by their Sleight of Hand if they previously attempted to conceal something).
      - Can also be used to track another creature (opposed by their Stealth if they’re trying to avoid being followed).
      - Search is used when you are going to move around an area and investigate over time. For “at a glance” tests, use Perception.

  - Sleight of Hand (COO)
    
      - Active, Physical
      - Used for pick-pocketing, hiding (or retrieving) objects on your person, misdirection and simple tricks and illusions.
      - Can be opposed by the Perception of anyone watching you.
      - Example Specializations: illusions, pick-pocketing

  - Soothe (SAV)

      - Active, Social
      - Your ability to calm others, be a sympathetic presence, and help them work through stress and trouble.
      - Used to help other characters handle *stress*; see *Injury and Healing*.
      - Example Specializations: Bed-Side Manner, Moment of Crisis, Long-Term Care, Negotiation

  - Spellcraft (COG)
    
      - Active, Physical, Mental, Technical
      - Your ability to manipulate magic to create spells.
      - Used to design, learn and cast spells.
      - Knowledge about the workings of magic is represented by Knowledge: Magic, while understanding magic as a profession is covered by Profession: Mage.
      - Example Specializations: by power, by type of magic (conjuration, teleportation, etc.).

  - Survival (INT)
    
      - Active, Physical
      - Represents your ability so survive in the wilds, away from civilization.
      - Can be used to build shelters, hunt, find food and water in the wild, identify hazardous natural features, know how to survive in hostile environments like deserts and tundras.
      - Special: you can use Survival \[Urban\] to represent a character’s ability to survive on the streets of a large city.
      - Example Specializations: by terrain type (woodlands, jungles, deserts, tundras, etc.)

  - Stealth (COO)
    
      - Active, Combat, Physical
      - Represents your ability to go unnoticed.
      - Used for sneaking about; if you’re trying to sneak past an observer, used opposed by the guard’s Perception.
      - Can be used to blend in to a crowd, in which case it’s usually used unopposed.
      - If you are trying to follow someone without being noticed, then it is opposed by that person’s Perception.
      - Can be used to travel without leaving a trail.
      - To avoid being seen, you normally need something to hide behind; it’s hard to hide from someone if they can plainly see you.
      - Some sense (like Scent or Mage Sight) might also render Stealth impractical.
      - Sample Specializations: Sneaking, Blending In

  - Unarmed Combat (SOM, Proficiency Skill)
    
      - Active, Attack, Combat, Melee Attack, Physical
      - Your skill with various techniques for unarmed combat.
      - The Unarmed Combat skill also covers the use of many worn weapons (like sapper’s gauntlets), and the use of most natural weapons (like claws and fangs).
      - However, unarmed combat does *not* cover the use of natural attacks like acid spit (which would use Ranged Weapons) or a natural magical ability (which would most likely be described by a power).
      - Sample Proficiencies: Defense, Grappling, Locks, Strikes, Throws, *by natural weapon*

Sidebar: Unusual Skills

  - Sometimes you’ll want your character to be able to do something that
    isn’t exactly covered by a skill—like tracking game through the
    woods.
  - While players can use an Exotic Skill to take ranks in an unusual
    skill, they are usually better served by taking an existing skill
    with a descriptive specialization. For example, players would almost
    always be better off taking Search \[Tracking\] than taking Exotic
    Skill: Tracking.
  - The Knowledge and Profession skills can also be used to establish a
    specific special skill-set for a character—for example, Profession:
    Hunter.
  - In addition to thinking about how you want to represent your
    character’s talents, think about how you want to be able to *use*
    the skill during a game.
  - If you’re unsure about a skill selection, you should discuss it with
    the GM; make sure that the GM understands not only what you want the
    skill to represent, but what you want to be able to *do* with it,
    and be sure that you and the GM agree with not only what the skill
    is supposed to represent, but what it’s supposed to do and how it’s
    supposed to work.

Sidebar: Gotchas and Confusing Cases

  - Disguise only covers the *physical* half of pretending to be someone
    else; for the social half—that is, to talk to people without being
    discovered—you’ll also need Deception.
  - Search is used to actively search an area for something; it takes
    time, and you move around. Perception is usually used for noticing
    things quickly—seeing things when you enter a room, as opposed to
    after looking around. Search is also used to track someone or
    something.
  - Control is used to manage your own magical energies, and to develop
    sleights; it should not be used to represent a characters “will
    power,” that’s the WIL attribute.
  - Normally, solving a crime would be treated as Solving a Logic Puzzle
    (requiring a COG × 3 check, as below). If you would like to build a
    detective character, consider using Profession: Detective or
    Profession: Investigator to represent your character’s ability to
    solve mysteries.
