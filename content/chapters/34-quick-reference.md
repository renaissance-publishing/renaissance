| -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Item cost is more than 1 less than wealth    | don't deplete dot            |
| Item cost is 1 less than wealth level        | deplete dot or barter; barter at \+20  |
| Item cost is the same as wealth level        | deplete dot or barter        |
| Item cost is 1 higher than wealth level      | deplete dot or barter; barter at \-20  |
| Item cost is more than 1 greater than wealth | cannot purchase              |
