## Using Magic

  - I’ve been moving this section around a lot. I’ve removed it before,
    when it was just talking about rituals, and then I added it back in
    the character guide. But, now that it’s also talking about mages and
    psions, I’ve decided to put it back in the mechanical section.
  - In general, magical abilities that you have ready access to are best
    represented as either powers, classes or items (see Powers below,
    and in Character Options).
  - As above, powers represent some action that you can perform: this
    might be a sleight that increases your armor, a spell that allows
    you to shield yourself with ice, or a blessing bestowed on you by a
    spirit that allows you to strike fear into their enemies.
  - Classes can be used to represent magical effects that aren’t
    actions. The Corpse-Herd class is an example of this: it represents
    the magical ability to build a corpse-minion that will serve you,
    but it’s presented as a class rather than a power because presumably
    you’ll only perform the action of making it occasionally (unless you
    get your corpse minion killed a lot).
  - Finally, items are useful to represent magical devices that you’ve
    created—like a bow that fires bolts of fire.

### Creating Magical Effects

  - What else can your character do with magic? Presumably, if you’re a
    skilled mage (i.e. if you have 40 or 50 ranks in Spellcraft), then
    surely you have other magical resources besides the powers that you
    have (or the ability to put on light shows, if you have the Mage
    class).

  - Indeed, skilled magic users, be they mages, psions or priests, can,
    with study and preparation, produce a wide variety of magical
    effects.
    
      - These effects are usually “one-off” events; they usually requrie
        (at least) a task action of several hours to achieve, and an
        appropriate skill check (either spellcraft or control for mags
        and psions, the situations being somewhat more complicated for
        priests).
      - We don’t provide detailed rules for exactly what kinds of
        effects can be created. The intent is that characters should be
        able to specify any magical effect (within reason) and then
        realize that result as a one-off effect with appropriate
        preparation.
      - The GM is the final arbiter for what is “within reason,” of
        course. This might even change: such is the nature of magic,
        that what is possible at one time in one area might not be
        workable in another.

  - Mages
    
      - Mages can produce a wide variety of useful effects. They usually
        do this by acquiring texts describing the manipulation of magic,
        researching and planning, preparing reagents and ultimately
        casting their spell.
        
          - For power effects, this process might be long and
            involved—it could even be an adventure unto itself\!
          - Mechanically, this usually involves at least a spellcraft
            check to design the ritual, and another spellcraft check to
            perform it.
          - knowledge: magic, profession: mage and research might all
            also be required, especially for complex, unusual or
            powerful rituals.
    
      - With a few hours of study and preparation, a mage might produce
        a great fireball or freeze over the surface of a lake.
    
      - With a few days of work, a mage might raise a shield over a
        house, or blight a field.
    
      - With weeks or months of works, mages might render a tower nearly
        indestructible, unleash a plague on a city, or construct a
        permanent bridge of light.

  - Psions
    
      - Psions can create powerful affects through meditation,
        concentration and mental discipline.
        
          - Psions often achieve this with hours of meditation and
            mental conditioning; this usually requires a control check.
    
      - With a few hours of preparation, a psion could suspend the
        progress of a disease, listen to the thoughts of someone nearby,
        render themselves immune to a hostile environment (as long as
        they can maintain their trance) or solve a complex logic puzzle.
    
      - With a few days of meditation and quiet contemplation, a psion
        could render themselves nearly immune to damage (as long as they
        can sustain the trance), cast their mind far from their bodies,
        or heal their wounded psyches (regaining some stress and trauma
        much like the rules for first aide).
    
      - With weeks or months of quiet contemplation and meditation,
        psions could make themselves younger, regrow limbs, modify their
        physical forms (growing a carapace, adding limbs), or probe the
        minds of distant enemies.

  - Priests
    
      - Priests can strike deals with spirits. Spirits are powerful, but
        also mysterious and mercurial: this makes this form of magic
        both incredibly powerful, but also incredibly complex and
        dangerous.
        
          - Bargaining with spirits is the *most powerful* form of magic
            available, especially if a suitably powerful spirit is
            contacted; however, it is also the most difficult and
            dangerous. See *Spirits* and the sections that follow it for
            more information.
          - More than designing a spell or meditating, striking a
            bargain with a spirit is best handled “cinematically.” A
            well-struck bargain can change the course of an adventure,
            but it’s also an intense encounter with a very powerful and
            (possibly) very alien being, and no two such encounters are
            alike.
          - Bargains with spirits are frequently local: different areas
            have different spirits, so any deal struck will depend on
            the spirits in an area that can be bargained with, and what
            abilities they have to offer. (Remember that spirits have a
            hierarchy: the spirits whose basin is a local glade might be
            relatively easy to bargain with, but also not very powerful;
            a spirit whose basin is an entire mountain might be
            extraordinarily powerful, but also almost impossible to bend
            to mortal wishes, or even to contact.)
    
      - Dealing with a spirit generally uses the following procedure:
        
          - Research Local Spirits
            
              - if you aren’t a priest in the area, you probably don’t
                know how the local spirits operate; even if you are,
                checking the library for any “gotchase” is wise.
              - Pay special attention to any binds that the spirits may
                have; messing up a bind with an uncooperative spirit
                might kill you\!
              - Normally an 8 hour Task Action, requiring a Research
                check, with Knowledge: Theology, Profession: Priest or
                similar as a related skill.
        
          - Design the Ritual
            
              - Normally a 4 hour Task Action, requiring a Profession:
                Priest or similar check.
              - Knowledge: Theology is a related skill, and an
                Exceptional or Critical Success on your Research test
                may help.
        
          - Perform the Ritual
            
              - a one hour Task Action, requiring a Profession: Priest
                or similar check.
        
          - Bargain with the Spirit
            
              - Once summoned—assuming it was summoned correctly—you can
                now bargain with the spirit. This is done in-character,
                using your social skills.
              - Rituals don’t have error messages; it’s possible that
                things can go completely wrong in ways that might not be
                obvious.

## Designing and Using Powers

General rules for powers

  - Powers represent some interesting *ability* that a character has.
    They can represent magical powers, unique physical abilities,
    martial maneuvers, or other abilities.

  - Powers usually either
    
      - represent an action (in which case they’ll say what type of
        action they require to perform, and how to resolve them), or
      - modify other powers.

  - Powers can be taken from the example list, but players can also
    develop their own. GMs must approve powers developed by players;
    this process usually takes the form of a conversation between the GM
    and the player, trying to achieve the effect that the player wants
    in a way that is reasonable and that works within the rules of the
    game.

  - Here are some good guidelines to follow for designing powers:
    
      - Powers should usually be D10 based; this is a D% system, and
        players are likely to have D10s handy.
    
      - Powers should either require ranks in a Skill, or be linked to
        some other power that requires ranks in a Skill, or both.
    
      - In general, when a power adversely affects another character, an
        opposed check should be made. Usually only one check should be
        called for; more than one is unfair to the attacker, fewer than
        one is unfair to the defender.
        
          - Note that the “opposed check” doesn’t have to be the skill
            that the power is linked to. The “opposed check” for
            Fireball, for example, is the Thrown Weapon attack to hit a
            target with it.
    
      - Since characters will get few powers (compared to D\&D, for
        example), each power should be *versatile*. Clever players
        should be able to find a number of uses for their powers.
    
      - Conversely, to keep things interesting and to give other
        characters a chance to contribute, each power should have
        situations where it clearly *does not* apply.
    
      - Powers can build on one another; if you’re having trouble
        building a power, it might help to split it into two powers in a
        sequence.
    
      - Powers should not negate the need for a given skill; for
        example, a “tongues” power is a bad idea, because it sidesteps
        the ‘languages system’ and removes any incentive players might
        have to learn other languages.
        
          - This is why fireball is treated as a normal held object, so
            the Ranged Weapons skill (with a Thrown proficiency) is
            required to make best us of it.
          - it’s also why we have Blur and not Invisibility; to use Blur
            effectively, you still need ranks in Stealth.
    
      - Avoid Powers (especially maneuvers) that represent things that
        any expert should be able to do. Remember that a character with
        40 ranks in One-Handed Weapons is a master swordsman; they
        shouldn’t need to purchase any specific powers to do things that
        any skilled swordsman would be able to do.
    
      - Avoid Powers that would be “mandatory” for any given character
        design. There shouldn’t be a power that every social character
        needs to take to be functional, for example.
    
      - A “full invisibility” power is a real bad idea.
    
      - Also avoid D\&D-style instant heals; healing is supposed to be
        difficult, and wounds sustained in combat are supposed to have a
        real impact (for the rest of the combat at least, and preferably
        into at least the next scene).

  - Some useful definitions:
    
      - Spell: a power that requires ranks in the Spellcraft skill;
        assumed to draw power from ambient magical energies.
      - Sleight: a power that requires ranks in the Control skill;
        assumed to draw power from personal magical energies.
      - Maneuver: a power that requires ranks in a Combat skill; a
        combat maneuver achieved by great skill, without the aid of
        magic (unless it’s also a spell, sleight or boon)
      - Boon, Blessing: a power that has been granted by a Spirit,
        possibly drawing power from them or their Basin.

## Luck

Characters (Player Characters and major NPCs) have a Luck stat, and a
certain numbr Luck Points. All characters acquire 1 Luck for free, and
characters can purchase more Luck during Character Creation. Luck
represents an extra edge, an extra bit of fortune and favor that
characters can use to make sure they get the job done despite the odds.

A player’s Luck stat is the maximum number of luck points they may have
(and the number of Luck Points they start with); the number of luck
points they currently have will fluctuate over the course of a game.
Players may spend Luck Points to do the following:

  - After a check:
    
      - “Flip” a check result (i.e. replace a 94 with a 49)
      - Upgrade the result

  - Before a check:
    
      - Ignore the negative modifiers to a test

Players have several ways to regain luck points:

  - Players regain 1 luck point at the start of a session
  - Players may be awarded 1 luck point for achieving a major success
    that contributes to one of their motivations
  - Players may be awarded 1 luck point for excellent roll-playing

Finally, players may loose luck points for:

  - A major failure relating to one of their motivational goals
  - A major failure at role-playing, such as acting against a
    character’s motivations

Sidebar: How many Luck Points can you spend on a check?

  - As far as the rules go, there is no set limit: a player could spend
    a point of luck to remove all penalties, then spend a luck point to
    flip a test from an 81 to a 18 to pass the test, and then spend a
    luck point again to upgrade that to an exceptional success.
  - GMs who want a tougher game for their players—or who don’t want
    their players to dump Luck Points at the end of each session—may
    limit their use of luck, allowing only one point to be spent on a
    test (for example).

Thought: rename this* *back to Moxie, or something else more general,
and make it do more things. I already have a couple of abilities that
allow you to do stuff with Luck, and I like them; I have a couple more I
wanted to add, except that linking them to “Luck” doesn’t make much
sense.

“Resolve” might also work.
