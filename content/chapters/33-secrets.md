## Secrets

Throughout the book, we've left some important details undefined: how do the Deep-Explorer Dwarves travel through the world?  How many leapers are there?  What secrets do the Great Spirits hide?

We've done this deliberately; these are gaps that we intend for *GM*s to fill in when they design their worlds.
This means that we don't have to saddle GMs and players with huge amounts of "meta-plot" that they have to keep track of—or that can spoil the surprise if players are *already* familiar with the secret parts of the "mythos."

Of course, the down-side of this is that GMs *have to* fill in these blanks in order to have a completed world.
What is the Ashen Mind?
Maybe a certain GM doesn't find this question interesting—but one of their *players* might want to incorporate it into their character, so that GM has to come up with a good-enough answer.

For that reason, we're going to talk about some of the setting's Big Questions, and discuss some of their possible answers; if you're a GM, you can use one of our answers, or come up with your own.

## The Leapers

The Leapers are the mysterious race that formed the Shaded-Sea Peoples by forcing the Shade Elves and Shaded-Sea Ratfolk to become their tributaries.
Most common-folk have probably never heard of them—the only people who have seen them directly are the elites and rulers of far-away nations.
For those who *have* heard of them, they're as like as not to regard them as rumors and legends—stories that the brutal leaders of the Shaded Sea use to keep their subjects in-line.

Of course, those who live underground are more likely to take the Leapers seriously, since they're a real and on-going threat to Dwarven holds, Ash Elf settlements and Kobold cities—even if they know little about them beyond that they exist and that they are hostile.
The Leapers appear from the dark and vanish into dead-end tunnels; no-one knows how they do this, where they go, or even how many of them there are.

When the Leapers attack, they carry off treasure, captives and food—the fate of those captives is unknown, although no-one suspects it's pleasant.

Of course, some cultures know a little more about them than others.
For one, the Clay Men have had far more contact with the Leapers than they would like.
The Clay Men have lived deep underground since time immemorial—they likely have lived underground even longer than the Leapers themselves have.
The Clay Men have skirmished with the Leapers since before the Empire of Man fell—and for more than three hundred years, the Leapers have been waging a campaign of extermination against them.
The Clay Men are particularly durable and have offered a formidable defense, but even they have slowly lost ground.
One motivation the Clay Men had for joining the Commonwealth with the signing of the Compact was having an ally against their determined, genocidal foe.

The Deep-Explorer Dwarves are a more recent arrival in the dark caves and caverns deep below the surface, but, as they've gone deeper, they've increasingly conflicted with the Leapers.
Few outside their communities know what form these conflicts have taken, or what the Deep-Explorer Dwarves may have learned.

Of course, the generals and governors of the Commonwealth take the Leaper threat seriously—both as the power holding the Shaded Sea together, and a threat to Commonwealth communities underground.
Much of what they know about the Leapers comes from the Clay Men, who have enthusiastically shared what they know, the best to prepare their new allies to fight their common enemy.
Even this leaves many important questions unanswered.

### The Few

## The Ashen Mind

The *Ashen Mind* is a major part of Fire's background.
It is a malevolent force from a domain outside the normal universe, associated with themes of fire and ash.
It cannot manifest itself directly on the Emerald Plane—the "normal" world is a very different place from the region it exists in; it has to find ways to *project* its influence onto the Emerald Plane, possibly requiring it to recruit local collaborators—or at least local patsies.
Likewise, beings from the Emerald Plane—mortal and spirit alike—cannot enter the *Ashen Fringe* where it resides.

The Ashen Mind is ancient, hostile, and almost entirely beyond the reach and knowledge of those on the Emerald Plane—including even Great Spirits, whose domains may stretch over the entire Emerald Plane, but whose power and understanding does not extend into the Fringe.
No-one knows what its ultimate goals are, why its so ceaselessly aggressive, or if there's any way to fight it; equally, no mortals know what role it's had in the affairs of the Great Spirits, or what it might know about them.

### Using the Ashen Mind

You have choices in how you use the Ashen Mind.
It dwells in a distant realm, with a distinct geometry, and it can't directly enter the Emerald Plane; so, one option is to simply ignore it.
It is distant, alien, and powerful, and it lives in an area of *strange geometry*; you can treat it much like a figure from the Cthulhu mythos, as the driving villain for an "out-of-context problem," manifesting in mysterious, space-bending anomolies swirling around mysterious cults and conspiracies.
Finally, it's a powerful and malevolent spirit associated with themes of fire and ash; it makes a decent stand-in for Satan if you'd like to have a good-old-fashioned "demonic" invasion—smashing hordes of outer-realm invaders with swords is always fun.

## Guardians

Most of the secrest we've laid out are dangers and enemies—which makes sense, since adventures require enemies.
The Guardians are a rare thing in horror-themed games: a powerful ally.
Guardians also inject ideas from transhumanist hard sci-fi; we do this because of our preference for realism, because several of the authors like Transhumanist hard sci-fi, and because it makes them jarringly alien.

### Guardian Civilization

The Guardians are an offshoot of the Gardener civilization, the earliest seeds of which arose more than 800,000 years ago, on a world more than 600 light-years away—the Shepherds.
By the time the Shepherds first landed one of their own on another world in their solar-system—an event which occurred 776,000 years ago—they already understood much about how their own minds worked, about how intelligence worked, about the dynamics of neurons, about the chemistsry of cells, and more; and they where already abandoning their original nature, and embracing their ability to manipulate and transform themselves.

They expanded: first, they settled much of their own solar systems, creating variants of themselves adapted to the diverse environments there, from carbion-dioxide hot-houses to amonia-poisoned seas locked within asteroids.
Then, they reached out, settling nearby worlds by deploying automated probes; these probes carried the ability to reconstruct installations, robots, and bodies, as well as stored minds to occupy the colonies that they would build.
They encountered other races—some impossibly sophisticated, some far less developed, and a rare few that where roughly peers.
Two of those peer civilizations, they incorporated, adding to the diversity of biologies, cultures, technologies, and minds they could draw from.

They where, in general, a benign and enlightened people.
They respected the autonomy of the younger races they encountered, taking pains to allow them to chart their own future and development.
However, the universe is less benign—it contains threats that can whipe out a young civilization.
To preserve younger races from these threats, the Gardeners founded the Guardians, an order responsible for preserving younger civilizations against threats that could whipe them out.

At their peak some 235,000 years ago, the Gardeners had spread to more than thirty-five star-systems; their Guardians had also sheltered more than a dozen younger civilizations through crisis that might have whiped them out.
It was then that catastrophy struck, and an ancient and malevolant force—believed to be a culture far more advanced than they where—destroyed their civilization.

The Gardeners where capable of constructing single probes that could colonize worlds—and produce more probes.
It is almost impossible to *completely* exterminate such a civilization.
Nevertheless, the Gardeners are no longer a powerful, thriving civilization; they have been reduced to a handful of well-hidden outposts and installations, hidden deep within dead worlds orbiting red-dwarf stars, or burried in lonely asteroids, and a fleet of probes, scattered and hidden, waiting to begin to rebuild their civilization—once they can be certain the threat has passed, if it ever does.

The Guardian order that they spawned survived the catastrophy—although in much the same condition as the Guardians themselves, reduced to a handful of well-hidden outposts and scattered probes.
It also continues to operate, attempting to fullfill its original mission—the preservation of civilization against existential threats.
Tragically, that mission has now come to include their own parent civilization.

### How Guardians Operate

Guardians missions are scattered throughout hundreds of lightyears.
They spread much like their founding civilization did, using self-replicating probes; a probe will land on a planet, and, using sophisticated technologies—including both synthetic and biological constructs at various scales, from the microscopic to the massive—will build an outpost, supporting facilities, and bodies.
The outposts then build more probes, and launch them towards unvisited stars.
These outposts are always well-hidden, both to avoid altering or diflecting younger cultures and to defend the Guardians themselves from their enemies.

These probes contain stored *mind-states*, which Guardians use to occupy these outposts.
Some are run as software, inhabing sophisticated computing systems; others are written into the brains of constructed bodies.
Guardians have a very transhumanist—or perhaps transbiological—view of the self.
They understand minds as *information*, and they separate individuals by how different those information-states are.
They are also capable of *modifying* those information-states, so that individual minds can be made to be well-suited for their specific missions.

Guardians take great care to hide information about themselves, both from the endangered cultures that they seek to protect, and from their own potential enemies—including dangerous civilizations that might seek to finish the job of whiping them out.
Guardian outposts are always well hidden, and "primary" Guardian bases are almost never placed directly on the worlds they wish to protect.
Guardians also almost never expose "full" Guardian mind-states to danger—they almost never venture outside of their well-defended and hidden outposts.
Instead, Guardians may build limited "remotes" on the worlds that they seek to protect; remotes may be little more than transmitters and fabricators, allowing a nearby installation to construct resources in-the-field.
Remotes are often constructed as simply as possible, making minimal use of advanced technologies; this is done both to minimize the amount of damage that they could ever do to younger cultures, and to prevent potential enemies—like the civilization that overthrew the Gardeners—from learning too much about them.
They also typically deploy *limited* or *pruned* mind-states to remotes; they will never put sensitive information—like the location of Guardian outposts or, even worse, surviving Gardener installations—within reach of other races.

Both the Gardeners and the Guardians have the capability to travel and communicate faster-than-light, although they use this capability extremely sparingly; one possible theory for why they where destroyed was their use of these technologies.
Guardians primary use of these technologies today is to "sync up" different Guardian outposts, allowing them to coordinate, to back up their mind-states, and to communicate new technologies.

One consequence of Guardians' transhumanist views is that they often have very different views of the self and mortality than younger civilizations do.
To a Guardian, there is no meaningful difference between two different instances of one "information stae"—of one mind.
In particular, they may not be concerned if several instances of a mind-state are destroyed, as long as one survives.
However, as minds operate, they change; if, over time, two minds-states become significantly different, they will be treated as different individuals, both worthy of being preserved.
This means that there is often not a one-to-one correlation between identities and bodies, and that individual Guardian minds—if they are identical to some other mind—may care little for their own preservation.
Guardians can copy minds into and out of bodies, and manipulate them as information; Guardians may be perfectly willing to sacrifice "themselves"—or a given instance of themselves—if they know that a recent back-up exists elsewhere.

### A Guardian Mission

We will describe some example Guardian missions, but one useful thing to bear in mind is that they can be as varied and bizarre as they need to be: remember that Guardians have the benefit of 500,000 years of technological development, that they drew from several different source civilizations, and that they use as much or as little of this technology as they need.
This is true of both Guardian artifacts and the Guardians themselves; the Guardians have a sophisticated ability to architect their minds and bodies to be well-suited to the mission at hand.
This means that individual Guardians may have wildly different biologies—or may not be biological at all—and may also have very different skills, bodies of knowledge, and outlooks.
