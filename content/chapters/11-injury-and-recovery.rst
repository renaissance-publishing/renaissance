Physical Injury
---------------

We use the same rules for taking damage, regardless of if the damage is
inflicted by a weapon attack, a disease, a magical ability, or something
else.

Characters who are injured receive Damage, in an amount given by the
source’s Damage Value (DV). (If you are attacked by a weapon, this would
be the weapon’s DV, for example.) When the amount of damage that you
have taken equals your DUR, you are disabled; you are too badly injured
to take action, and likely unconscious. When the amount of damage that
you have taken reaches your Death Rating (DR), your character has been
killed.

Any time you take damage, you might also suffer *wounds*. If the amount
of damage you take at one time exceeds your Wound Threshold, then one
wound is inflicted. If you take damage that equals or exceeds twice your
Wound Threshold, you take two wounds, and so on; so, if your DUR was 30
and your WT was 6, and you then took 15 damage, you would also take 2
wounds.

   <aside class="clarification float">

Note the “at one time” in the above; you have to take WT DV or more *at
once*. Suppose some source of damage is causing 1 DV to a character over
and over again; this might cause a character to reach their DUR or DR
without ever taking a single wound.

How severe is a *Wound*? It’s an injury severe enough to impede a
character, without completely debilitating or killing them. A single
*Wound* might represent a *stab wound* caused by a knife, or a broken
bone.

   </aside>

   <aside class="designnote">

The “progressive wound system” is one bit of *Eclipse Phase* heritage
that makes *Renaissance* very different from D&D. In *Renaissance*, as
characters start to get stabbed by swords, they start to get debilitated
*rapidly*, even while they’re still (mechanically) far from death; this
gives the game a very different feel from games where “the only
hit-point that matters is the last one,” and it can come as quite a
surprise to players who aren’t expecting it!

.. raw:: html

   </aside>

When a wound is inflicted, you must roll SOM×3; penalties from wounds
and traumas apply, including the wound that caused the check. If you
fail, you are knocked down.

For every wound that has been inflicted, you suffer a -10 penalty to all
actions (note that this includes mental actions, since wounds are
painful and distracting). At the GM’s discretion, specific wounds might
inflict other effects; a wound to the head might render a character
unconscious, for example, while a wound to a character’s legs might
*break* one of them and reduce their movement.

.. raw:: html

   <aside class="gmguidance float">

Most of the time, you won’t need to specify a specific Wound with a
special effect; it’s usually sufficient to tell a player that they
suffer a Wound.

Giving a specific description and special effect to a wound is mainly
useful for adding a “cinematic” feel to an important moment.

.. raw:: html

   </aside>

Sometimes, a character will have the ability to *Negate* a wound. When
this happens, the character may ignore the -10 penalty imposed by that
wound. Note that a *negated* wound has not fully healed; the character
simply isn’t hindered by it. Also, only the -10 penalty is negated; any
other effects persist. You cannot, for example, *negate* having your
hand chopped off in order to wield a two-handed weapon.

Mental Stress
-------------

Mental stress works much like physical damage. Difficult circumstances
can inflict *stress* according to their Stress Value (SV); see the table
below for example *sources of stress* and *stress values*. When a
character’s stress exceeds their Lucidity (LUC), they succumb to the
enormous strains they are under, and cannot act until their Stress is
lowered below their Lucidity. If that character’s stress exceeds their
Insanity Rating (IR), they are irreparably traumatized (and are removed
from the game as surely as if they had died).

.. raw:: html

   <aside class="playerguidance">

Players who think their character might be *resistent* (or even
*immune*) to a particular source of stress should consider the *Unique
Outlook* and *Hardened* traits.

.. raw:: html

   </aside>

.. raw:: html

   <aside class="gmguidance">

Unlike *physical damage*, what is *stressful* can depend strongly on a
character.

For the most part, we recommend that you rely on *explicit, mechanical*
systems for deciding what is stressful; these include a character’s
*motivations*, as well as the *Unique Outlook* and *Hardened* traits.
(If it helps you to be a stickler, we did just advise your players to
buy the *Unique Outlook* and *Hardened* traits!)

However, dramatically-minded GMs certainly can take into account a
character’s history, personality and outlook—and they should also
consider input from dramatically-minded players.

.. raw:: html

   </aside>

Unlike physical damage, stress can be resisted. Whenever a character
takes stress, they may be permitted to roll a WIL×3 check to *resist*
it: if they succeed, then they do not take Stress, while if they fail,
they take the given Stress value. Some sources of stress are more
difficult to resist than others, which is represented by the following
*tags*:

-  A source of stress that is *difficult to resist* allows only a WIL×2
   test to resist it (instead of the normal WIL×3).
-  A source of stress that is *overwhelming* cannot be completely
   resisted; if a character succeeds on a check to *resist* it, they
   still take half the SV.

If a character receive stress at one time that exceeds their Trauma
Threshold (TT), they suffer a Trauma (and they can receive multiple
Traumas at a time, if they receive enough Stress at one time to exceed a
multiple of their Trauma Threshold). The character suffers a -10 penalty
to all actions for each Trauma that they have. When a character receives
a Trauma, they must roll a WIL×3 check; if they fail, they are stunned
for one round (penalties from their wounds and traumas apply, including
the Trauma that caused the test).

The GM may sometimes decide that a Trauma has a specific effect on a
character—such as the overpowering urge to avoid the source of Stress
that caused the Trauma. These effects are generally meant to be
roll-played, and they usually last until the Trauma itself has been
healed.

Sometimes Traumas can be *negated*. When this occurs, the Trauma is not
healed; the character is simply able to function effectively in spite of
it.

The table below lists example *stress sources*, their *tags*, and their
normal *stress values*.

============================================= ====== ===================
Stress Source                                 Stress Tags

Healing
-------

Most characters heal naturally, albeit slowly, from both physical and
psychological harm:

-  Characters heal 1 DV per day. After all DV has been healed, they heal
   1 Wound per *week*.
-  Characters heal 1 SV per day. After all SV has been healed, they heal
   1 Wound per *month*.

Of course, some characters can heal at very different rates; when this
is the case, it will be indicated by some feature the character has.
Notably, several races have *Fast Healing*, which allows them to heal
*much* faster (*Fast Healing* is described in *Senses, Movements and
Special Abilities*).

Also notable are the *Heal* sleight (which grants a character
*fast-healing*); the *Down-Time* sleight (which allows a character to
heal *stress* quickly); and several alchemical potions that (slightly)
accelerate natural haling.

Healing Damage with Medicine
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Characters can use the *Medicine* skill to *bind* Wounds. Binding a
Wound is a Task Action with a time frame of 10 minutes. It requires a
*Medicine* check; on a success, the character whose wounds are being
bound recovers 1d10 DV, and can *negate* one Wound (the Wound must
ultimately heal naturally). Only one attempt can be made to bind any
given Wound; if the attempt fails, the character will simply have to
heal naturally.

Under some circumstances, characters can use the *Medicine* skill to
attempt *surgery*. Surgery can be used to heal some *conditions*, at the
GM’s discretion. Surgery can also be used to treat a *Wound* that was
not successfully *bound*. Surgery is particularly difficult, however,
and, in the era before the germ theory of disease, can be particularly
dangerous for the patient. A surgical attempt is a 1 hour *Task Action*
that requires a *Medicine check* with a -20 penalty; on a success, the
*condition* may be cured, or the *Wound* is successfully bound (as per
the rules for binding a wound).

Healing Stress with Soothe
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While a modern theory of psychology is centuries away, a patient and
empathetic person can still help someone to handle a stressful situation
or process a traumatic event.

Characters can use the *Soothe* skill to reduce another character’s SV.
The participation of the person being “*soothed*” is a vital component
of this process; it requires a degree of trust between the participants,
and it requires the person being *soothed* to be willing to open up with
someone and work through their problems. Mechanically, this is a 1 hour
*Task Action*, requiring a *Soothe* check from the character providing
emotional support and a WIL×3 check from the character receiving
support; if both checks are successful, the character receiving support
recovers 3 SV; if only one of the checks is successful, the character
recovers 1 SV.

.. raw:: html

   <aside class="designnote">

Soothe heals significantly less SV than Medicine heals DV. This is
intentional; managing stress and working through psychological issues is
a time-consuming process!

We also don’t provide fixed rules for healing Traumas with Soothe. It’s
centuries before the development of psychotherapy, and the development
of the kinds of techniques that could be used to heal, for example, a
phobia.

That’s not to say that Soothe *can’t* be useful in a character’s healing
process, of course; it’s just to say that that process isn’t well
understood by characters in the word of Renaissance, and that Soothe
doesn’t cover all of it.

   <aside class="gmguidance">

Of course, since this process involves a detailed, frank discussion
between two characters at a time that is particularly stressful for at
least one of them, it can be an obvious candidate for *role-playing*.
However, it doesn’t *have* to be role-played in depth: not all players
are dramatically minded, and some may not care to delve into their
character’s emotional states; or a player may be uncomfortable acting
out such an intimate and emotional moment; or a player might be a
scenery-chewer who will devour the play-mat if given the chance.

As so many other things, whether the GM proceeds through this process
mechanically, has players outline the interaction, or has them play it
out in detail depends on the situation and the mood at the table in that
moment.

Long-Term Care
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Characters can *convalesce*, spending time resting and relaxing
(possibly with the support of doctors, priests or other healers) to
recover from their physical and mental wounds.

Long-Term Care can provide physical care, psychological care, or both—a
character convalescing at a peaceful temple could receive both physical
and mental care at the same time, for example. A character who rests and
receives medical care heals more quickly: instead of their natural
healing, for each day a character spends resting and recovering, they
recover 3 DV; they heal one wound every 4 days, after all damage has
been healed. Likewise, a character who spends time resting and
processing their traumas recovers more quickly: instead of their natural
healing, they heal 3 SV per day, and they heal one Trauma per week after
all stress has been healed.

Conditions, Potions, Poisons and Diseases
-----------------------------------------

conditions
~~~~~~~~~~

-  Conditions have *effects* that persist while the condition applies to
   you, and rules for *removing* the condition it (which might be as
   simple as a *duration,*\ after which the condition ends).

-  Bleeding:

   -  effects:

      -  1 DV every minute.
      -  Bleeding characters are easy to follow; pursuers gain a +20
         bonus on Search and Perception checks.

   -  end:

      -  successful First Aid check, as a 1 minute Task Action

Potions and Poisons
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Both are chemicals that affect characters.

-  Both have *effects* which persists for the potion or poison’s
   *duration*.

-  They may have an *onset time* before the effects occur, and they may
   allow *resistance checks* to partially resist the potion’s effects.

-  Potions:

   -  are usually beneficial, and
   -  are usually drunk (you can retrieve and drink a potion as a Quick
      Action).

-  Poisons:

   -  are usually harmful, and

   -  are often either added to food or drink, or are coated on weapons.

   -  If a poison is coated on a weapon, then, on the first attack that
      causes a wound,

      -  the wounded target is effected by the poison, and
      -  the poison on the weapon is consumed
      -  (traces may linger, so handling the weapon may be dangerous,
         and the poison may still be detectable if the weapon is
         examined).

-  For sample Potions and Poisons, see the *Items* section.

Diseases
~~~~~~~~

-  Diseases have an *resistance check*, and *onset time,* a *duration,
   effects* and possibly *treatment*.

-  Some diseases may have effects based on how long the character has
   been infected—that is, the effects may proceed through *stages*.

-  When a character is first exposed to a disease, they make their
   *resistance check*; if they succeed, then they have not been
   infected.

-  If infected, once the *onset time* has passed, the symptoms of the
   disease manifest; at this point, the *effects* of the disease apply.

-  The symptoms then last for the *duration*; once this has passed, the
   disease and its effects end.

-  Finally, some diseases have a specific *treatment*. The effects of
   treatment vary, ranging from curing the disease entirely, to allowing
   an additional Resistance check, to shortening the duration.

   -  Of course, some powers, potions and means magical and medical can
      also be used to cure diseases.

-  Characters can be deliberately exposed to disease: weapons can be
   coated with the blood and viscera of the infected, food can be made
   from tainted meat, and the infected can choose to enter and mingle
   among a population to spread their disease, for example.

-  Flu

   -  Resistance: DUR × 2
   -  Onset: 1 Day
   -  Duration: 3 Days
   -  Effects: fatigue, aches and nausia

-  Black Death

   -  Resistance: DUR
   -  Onset: 3 Days
   -  Duration: 1 week
   -  Effect: high fever, delerium, unconsciousness; 1d10 DV / day

-  Raking Cough

   -  Resistance: DUR × 2

   -  Onset: 1 Month

   -  Duration: permanent

   -  Effect: Sever cough, especially after exertion. Loss of stamina.

      -  Raking Cough progresses: characters suffer -5 DUR / month. When
         characters reach their DUR, they die.
