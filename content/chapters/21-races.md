title: "Races"
---

There are three separate keywords that have special significance in Race
entries. All races will have one of the following keywords: Natural,
Supernatural or Spirit. This tells you whether the race is
flesh-and-blood (Natural), has some inborn supernatural quality
(Supernatural), or is composed entirely of magical energy (Spirit).

Some races have optional Traits, Classes, Powers or Backgrounds. You
don’t acquire them for free; rather, they are added to your list of
options at character creation, and you may *optionally* select them
using all the normal rules for taking Traits, Classes, Powers or
Backgrounds during character creation. (So, for example, Shifters don't
*just have* the Animal Form trait, but they can purchase it during
character creation for CP, just like any other trait they are eligible
for.)

Game Design Note: narrowing the stuff you get in Races down to *only*
what every member of that species would have, regardless of background.
Moving other features (c.f. skill bonuses) to backgrounds. Adding
Optional Backgrounds to races that have unique sub-cultures (like Ash
Elves, Herders or Dwarves).

Game Design Note: races selection should be interesting, and should
affect how you play the character. However, you shouldn’t have to pick a
specific race to get a specific feature or be good at a specific job.
This is why many abilities were moved to Backgrounds, and why many
abilities are being replaced by Traits-for-free (so that any other Race
can just take the Trait if they want to).

## Common Races

### Drakes

  - Though it was long known that the Drakes where a created people, it
    was only a few hundred years ago, as power devolved to the people in
    the Dragonshire and as their alliance with the Commonwealth drew
    closer, that their true origin was revealed.

  - More than a century before the Old Charter, after Karrach claimed a
    swath of the Empire of Man, it had become apparent to him that he
    could not govern such a large territory on his own.
    
      - He had called other dragons to him, to share the rule of his
        kingdom as his lords and vassals, but dragons, though long-lived
        and mighty, where also few, and had little shared culture or
        history before his kingdom. Karrach need a *people*.

  - Karrach, aided by the dragons who answered his call, began a search
    for a powerful spirit willing to provide him a great boon—for a
    great price.
    
      - Ultimately, a spirit contacted him; it variably identified itself as *the Bulrush God*, *the Rainstorm Shepherd* and *the Osprey’s Father*, and it dwelt within the southern reaches of the Dragonshire.
      - The spirit’s actual basin remains unknown, as does the extent of
        its powers; they are certainly great, given what it did.
      - It gave Karrach and his followers instructions for creating holy
        sites—only the precious first few of which it has actually
        blessed—and a ritual they could perform there. The ritual would
        convert a dragon’s egg into a drake’s egg—drakes being creatures
        of dragon’s blood and kind, but smaller, less mighty and far
        more fertile.
      - The price the Bulrush God demanded was perhaps surprisingly
        cheap for what it did: it demanded ownership of a stretch of
        lowland marsh on the southern coast of the Dragonshire, fully 20
        kilometers along the coast and extending 7 kilometers inland,
        and a lordly title.
      - This represented an enormous risk for Karrach, as he knew of no
        way to bind the spirit, which was unknown to him.

  - The Bulrush God is still worshiped in the Dragonshire.
    
      - The Bulrush God is enigmatic; very little is known about it,
        neither its actual basin nor the true extent of its powers nor
        its ultimate goals.
      - The Bulrush God answers very few supplicants; it is not known
        what draws it. No bind for it is known—unsurprisingly, for a
        spirit of its power.
      - Conversely, the Bulrush God interferes little in the affairs of
        mortals and lesser spirits. Particularly, it has never used its
        lordly title, and it has not allowed settlement of the land it
        claims, and so has no subjects. (Neither has it forbidden the
        land to hunters or travelers, leading many to wonder what its
        actual intent with it was.)

  - Drakes frequently trace their lineages back to their Dragon
    forebears.
    
      - Each egg needed to be live; thus, all Drakes have at least two
        dragon ancestors, one male and one female.
      - The ritual to transform an egg required a price of each
        participant dragon; it was not undertaken lightly.
      - Though Drakes can nominally be broken into clans based on their
        lineage, their family trees where often rendered *complex* by
        feudal politics; for some, their clan and heritage are important
        parts of who they are; other drakes care little—or may not even
        know their ancestry at all.
      - Many Drake clans (or smaller noble families) claim noble titles
        and land-holdings—at least in principle.

  - In the early days of the Dragonshire, when they were a feudal
    territory (and most of the feudal lords were dragons), Drakes tended
    to take positions of authority, above Humans but below Dragons.

  - As political reforms took place, the role of Drakes, Dragons and
    Human leaders changed. The modern Dragonshire is a Commonwealth
    province, and power has been devolved from the hereditary nobility
    (of Drakes and Dragons) to civil Councils.

  - Still, Drakes largely think of themselves as being of “noble blood”,
    and many of them still hold hereditary titles – which may or may not
    be of practical significance.

  - Even though power in the Dragonshire has been devolved to civil
    councils, having the right lineage still helps: Drakes commonly hold
    positions of privilege and authority in the Dragonshire.

  - Because their culture is similar to that of the feudal Kingdoms of
    Man, Drakes find it fairly easy to interact politically with that
    neighboring state.

  - Drakes commonly serve in units of the Commonwealth Military that
    draw from the citizenry of the Dragonshire

  - Somewhat like Gnolls, Drakes also commonly take up jobs where their
    immense strength is an asset. However, because Drakes are much more
    comfortable in large cities, this tends to mean “blacksmithing” more
    often than it means “farm work”.

  - Drakes tend to be good-natured and sociable at best, but also brash,
    proud and stubborn at worst.

  - Appearance: Drakes are humanoid in gross layout, but they have the
    head, long tail, powerful limbs, tough scales and sharp claws of
    Dragons.

### Elves

  - Elves are a common people throughout the Emerald Plains.

  - Elves are humanoid in gross layout, although they have finer
    features (including long, pointed ears).
    
      - Elves have excellent hearing and vision.
      - Notably, elves are descended from arboreal creatures, and retain
        prehensile feet. These are larger than human feet, owing to
        being reinforced with extra tendons, bones and musculature;
        thanks to this reinforcement, Elves can run on open ground as
        well as humans.
      - Elves also have exotic skin pigmentations, which help them to
        blend in to natural environments.

  - There are three major Elven ethnic groups: Wood Elves, Shade Elves
    and Ash Elves.

  - Wood Elves are a tribal culture, dispersed throughout the
    northwestern portion of the Emerald Plane.
    
      - Wood Elves do not have a large, overarching nation; their tribes
        are usually more similar to nearby tribes of other races than to
        distant Wood Elves.
      - The Commonwealth’s interactions with wood elves have, for the
        most part, been peaceful; by the present day, the majority of
        the wood elf tribes have signed the Commonwealth Charter (and
        now the Commonwealth Compact).
      - However, most wood elf communities continue to practice
        traditional, tribal ways of life; they live within the vast
        interior swaths of the Emerald Plane, having little contact with
        outsiders, even though they are technically Commonwealth
        citizens.
      - Because of this, wood elves are rarely seen outside of their
        tribal communities.
      - Wood Elves typically live in small settlements, with a few
        planted fields around them. The able-bodied typically herd or
        hunt, while the very young, the very old and the infirm live in
        their settlements.
      - Wood Elves have a complex skin pattern, a little like an ocelot.
        Their bellies, underarms and inner thighs are a dull white,
        while their backs, arms and legs are a dark green. Running
        through this is a complex pattern of black spots and folding and
        curving lines. Their hair is often dark green or black; rarely,
        it is gold or orange.

  - Shade Elves are plains raiders hailing from the open plains on the
    southwest of the Emerald Plane.
    
      - Before the arrival of the Commonwealth, they preyed on the
        peoples and cultures near them, forcing some to pay tribute and
        raiding the others without mercy.
      - As the Commonwealth spread West and entered the Shade Elves’
        territory, some of the tribes they had preyed upon allied with
        those Commonwealth settlers.
      - The Commonwealth built a string of walled cities and fortified
        keeps on the path to the sea; after a disastrous siege led to a
        losing war, the Shade Elves’ territory was severely restricted.
      - This left the Shade Elves vulnerable to the Leapers, a
        subterranean race that overwhelmed their largest settlements and
        forced the Shade Elves to pay them tribute.
      - The Leapers later forced the Shade Elves to cooperate with their
        other tributaries, the Ratfolk of the Warren Isles; the
        resulting union came to be called the Shaded Sea Peoples, named
        for the sea that separated the Warren Isles from the Shade
        Elves’ territory on the southwest of the continent.
      - Shade Elves are still raiders, striking at settlements on the
        edge of the Commonwealth and on the northwest of the Raptor’s
        Plane.
      - They also participate in piracy, carried by Ratfolk ships and
        sailors.
      - As members of the Shaded Sea Peoples, they are one of the
        Emerald Plane’s great powers, and an enemy of the Commonwealth.
        They have been in conflict with the Commonwealth off-and-on for
        centuries.
      - Shade Elves live in small settlements dug into the bases of
        hills and the sides of mesas and river-valleys. Their
        settlements are usually fortified and walled, both to help
        fending of rebellions by their tributaries and predation at the
        hands of other Shade Elf clans.
      - Shade Elven skin is striped, a little like a tiger or zebra. The
        stripes alternate between a dark black and a dull grey. Shade
        Elven hair is similarly black and grey.

  - Ash Elves are urban, thoughtful and philosophical people; they are
    the descendants of Shade and Ash Elves who settled in the Haven
    Isles.
    
      - Many trace the origins of the Ash Elves to the siege of
        Islandholme by the Shade Elves in CY 447 and its aftermath, as
        Shade Elves taken hostage in the siege where slowly ingtegrated
        into the Commonwealth and interbred with Wood Elves.
      - Ash Elven settlements have also absorbed many refugees from the
        tumult and cruelty of Shade Elven culture, and have served as a
        familiar home for Wood Elves wishing to join a more urban
        culture.
      - Ash Elven culture was formed in the cities of the Haven Isles,
        influenced by the countless other traditions brought there by
        settlers from the rest of the Commonwealth.
      - Ash Elves are a very thoughtful people, and they are avid
        consumers of literature, art, law, philosophy, and other forms
        of scholarship. They also tend to be highly eclectic in the
        scholarship they consume, drawing for the intellectual
        traditions of races and cultures throughout the commonwealth.
      - Ash Elven culture is disciplined, mindful and meditative; they
        are often reserved, stoic in the face of danger, but vibrant and
        joyous in time of celebration.
      - Ash Elves tend to prefer urban environs, and can be found
        throughout the Commonwealth’s large cities.
      - Ash Elves have also built cities of their own; they tend to
        build large underground settlements, somewhat like those
        constructed by Dwarves and Kobolds.
      - Ash Elven culture is open, egalitarian and libertine; guests are
        welcome and well-treated, and they tend to get along well with
        their neighbors—especially dwarves and kobolds.
      - They are particularly known for the joyous celebrations that
        mark their holidays, in which their cities are brightly
        decorated and travelers and neighbors are welcome.
      - Ash Elves tend to be strong advocates for the Commonwealth’s
        continued peaceful expansion.
      - Ash Elven skin is mostly the color of ash, as the name implies;
        they have a few stripes along their backs, the tops of their
        arms, and the outside of their legs. The stripes are thing, and
        alternate between white and black. Their hair is often black,
        ash grey, pale white or ember orange.

Clan Swords are wooden weapons used by many Wood Elves.
They are carefully hewn from sturdy hardwood, and finished with designs unique to the tribe that produced them.

### Gnolls

Gnolls are one of the most numerous races on the Emerald Plane; much like Humans and Elves, they have long lived throughout the Emerald Plane.
Almost as sociable as humans and incredibly strong, Gnollish strength (and endurance) was the backbone of the early Commonwealth.

Gnolls are roughly humanoid in gross layout, but they have hyena-like features:
their head and feet are much like a hyena's;
they are covered in short, ochre fur much like a hyena's;
and they have a hyena's short tail.
Gnolls are also much larger and stronger than most other races—Drakes are perhaps the only common race that can exceed them.
Notably, Gnolls display less sex dimorphism than most other races do; as a result, Gnollish cultures tend to place less importance on an individual's sex.

Gnolls where one of the three races that cooperated under the auspices of the Old Charter to create the growing, prosperous culture of towns, manors and cities that would eventually become the Commonwealth.
When Gnollish refugees where granted a manor's charter by the Lord of a Human city, a new and unique culture was created, at least as similar to the urban Human culture that sheltered them as to any prior Gnollish culture;
this Gnollish culture was one of the ones that was spread west as the Commonwealth expanded, and that is still one of the Commonwealth's most common and distinctive cultures today.

Commonwealth Gnolls tend to be somewhat rural; they are common in the small villages and towns of the Commonwealth, but rare in its cities.
Though the idea of a Gnollish farmer may seem odd to some, they are in fact well-suited to it; their great strength and endurance is invaluable for farming work, and the *flexibility* of their diet can be invaluable in lean years.
(Though Gnolls are meat-eaters, they have discovered a number of useful recipes involving grains that provide them at least some nourishment, which they can use to greatly stretch meat reserves.)

Though Gnolls may be somewhat rustic by Commonwealth standards, their communities nevertheless tend to be open and welcoming;
their ancestor's flight from persecution at the hands of their cousins, and their salvation at the hands of people strange and alien to them&mdash;Humans&mdash;is very much alive in Gnollish culture, and strongly informs their traditions and values to this day.

Gnolls put quite a lot of effort into getting along with members of other communities, and will go out of their way to make other races feel comfortable around them.
Many Gnollish communities have two separate set of customs, one for when members of other races are around, and one for when they're not.
For example, Gnolls are carrion-eaters, and many other races may be revolted by some of the things that Gnolls may eat; for this reason, Gnollish communities often have a recipe of "guest-food," which both they and their guests can eat.
Gnolls are also aware of how savage and intimidating they can appear to be, so many of them put quite a lot of effort into developing refined personal styles: fine clothing, subtle jewelry, neat cuts of hair and mane, and died fur are all common.
Gnolls also commonly use veils to hide their predator's jaws from those who they do not with to frighten or intimidate.

Not every Commonwealth Gnoll stays in the small town where they are born.
Many Gnollish families have a long military tradition, and Gnolls make up almost two-thirds of the Commonwealth military's ranks.

Since the first Gnollish manors were settled besides Halfling neighbors, the two races have cooperated closely; Gnolls have long found employment with Halfling trade-caravans as guards.
To this day, many Halfling communities are located next to Gnollish ones, and clans of Halflings and Gnolls may have traditions of cooperation that go back centuries.
Gnolls that travel with Halfling caravans are often more urbane than their cousins; they are also more likely to go to great lengths to perfect a personal style that is just intimidating enough to scare off the wrong sort, without disturbing the paying customers as well!

There are also a number of Gnollish tribal communities in the territory to the west of the Worldspine Mountains.
Notably, much like their symbiosis with Humans and Halflings in the east, several Gnollish tribes allied with Herder communities in the west, where the frail Herders greatly valued them for their physical strength; this alliance became a force to be reckoned with in the west, and was the major opponent to the Shade Elves prior to the coming of the Commonwealth.

There is also a unique ethnic group of Gnolls hailing from stretch of snowy northland that lies to the east of the Worldspine mountains.
White-furred and adapted to the cold, these Gnolls have long lived on the snowy terrain above and around the subterranean holds of Dwarves, with whom they have long coexisted amicably; Snow Gnolls are expert hunters and herders, and they provide Dwarven holds with an invaluable source of meat.
Though few in numbers, the combination of these stealthy hunters scattered throughout the northern forests with the extreme resilience of Dwarven holds handily prevented the conquest of the North by the Empire of Man, and later by the Kingdoms of Men.

- Humans are also known for the great endurance; while many other races' energy ebbs and flows, humans can maintain a steady walking pace over great distances.
  They are also fare more resistant to shock than many other races are.
- Even today, Humans are widely renowned for their manual dexterity, for their society-building social instincts and their problem-solving abilities.
- One of the three founding races (besides Gnolls and Halflings), Humans are widely regarded as the “social problem-solvers” who helped bind together all the widely different communities that came together to form the early Commonwealth.
- Humans are frequently academics, professionals, scholars, lawyers and politicians.

### Kobolds

  - Kobolds are a relatively new addition to the Commonwealth; most
    Kobold communities trace their origins to a mass exodus from the
    Kingdom of Man roughly 200 years ago.

  - Kobolds are sociable, creative, and very quick.

  - Kobold culture is very family-oriented, and very community-oriented

  - Extended families tend to live together in large homes, and several
    families will cluster together to form a block.

  - Kobolds communities tend to have small personal spaces and large
    public spaces; Kobolds tend to take enormous pride the quality of
    their public spaces, which will commonly be excellently maintained,
    and will feature impressive monuments or natural landscapes.

  - Kobolds have a short lifespan, but they also tend to have large
    families; because of this, they have grown explosively
    
      - even though they were absorbed only recently, many of the
        largest Commonwealth city-states are underground Kobold
        metropolises.

  - They tend to live near Dwarves and Ash Elves, both of which are very
    long-lived. This can create some complex relationships: it is not
    uncommon for one Dwarf or Elf to closely befriend several
    generations of one Kobold family in succession, watching each
    generation come into adulthood, have children and pass away – an
    arrangement that can be very bittersweet for the Dwarf or Ash Elf
    involved.

  - Kobold culture strongly encourages industry, so Kobold communities
    tend to be highly productive.

  - They look like tiny, bipedal dragons. Somewhat like Drakes, their
    scales can take on a range of colors, and often metallic hues;
    however, unlike Drakes, this rarely has any effect on the Kobold in
    question.
    
      - Like Drakes and Dragons, and unlike other reptiles, Kobolds are
        warm-blooded.
      - Kobolds aren’t mammals; they don’t have mammary glands, and they
        have internal genitalia. Because of this, Kobolds can have very
        different ideas about what constitutes “appropriate attire”.

    Anyone you strike or bite must make a DUR+WIL check or be stunned for 5 turns.
  - Fire: your claws or bite are incredibly hot.
    Your attack does +3 DB, and you can set flammable objects on fire.

### Shifters

  - Shifters live in communities in the tribal territories; they are
    rare elsewhere.

  - Most shifter communities exist in tribal territories. Though most
    Shifter communities signed the Commonwealth Charter long ago, in
    practice, they have established few entanglements with outside
    communities.

  - Though not exactly insular, because they do not generally produce
    goods for export, they are not generally able to import goods from
    other communities, and so they tend to have little contact with
    other races.

  - Notably, Shifter communities tend to be very conservative. They are
    wary of outsiders, and are happy to live their lives much as they
    always have, and be left alone.

  - Small numbers of Shifters filter out of the tribal communities,
    seeking the exotic experiences the rest of the Commonwealth has to
    offer.

  - While there are a few Shifter manors, and some cities host notable
    Shifter populations, Shifters who leave the tribal territories often
    find themselves alone in their community, the only shifter in the
    town or village where they settle. Because of this, shifters outside
    the tribal territories tend to adopt the culture of the community
    they settle in.
    
      - Many shifters are not particularly social, so this often does
        not bother them as much as it might bother members of other
        species.

  - Shifters often find work that suits their personal inclinations,
    among the communities that they settle in; “their own inclination”
    is often affected by the tendencies of their hybrid form.

  - Appearance: In humanoid form, shifters somewhat resemble elves and
    humans. An individual shifter will often display traits appropriate
    to their hybrid form.

#### Shifter Vitals

Half elf, half human, half wild, Shifters can *shift* between humanoid and hybrid forms.

- Old Age: 90 Years
- Average Height: 1.8m
- Average Weight: 50kg
- Diet: Omnivore

- Senses: Normal, Low-Light
- Size: Medium
- Tags: Supernatural, Humanoid, Human, Elf, Shape-Shifter, Shifter
- Language Group: HHED (humanoid form); GR (hybrid form)
- *Hybrid*: You have two forms: Humanoid and Hybrid.
  - The specific details of each form are fixed.
    That is, your Humanoid form, for example, looks the same every time you *shift* to it; you can't determine what it looks like each time you shift.
    You can shift between forms at will; changing forms is a *Standard Action*.
    - In Humanoid form, you have a mixture of Human and (Wood) Elvish features.
    - In Hybrid from, you are roughly humanoid, but with the features of an animal.
  - When in *hybrid form*, you gain two of the following benefits (chosen when you create your character):
    - Claws: you have claws that do 2d10 DV, at -2 AP.
    - Teeth: You have a predator’s jaw, which allows you to bite foes.
      The bite does 1d10+2 DV at -2 AP.
      When you bite someone, if you score an Excellent Success, you may choose to *latch on*; this normally works like grappling the target.
    - Hearing: You have superb hearing, gaining +20 on auditory Perception checks.
    - Movement: you gain one of the following movement modes (in addition to your other movement modes):
      - Burrow 1/3
      - Climb 3/9
      - Flight 3/9/36
      - Glide 4/12/48
      - Hop 4/12
      - Swim 3/9
    - Scent: you have a superb sense of smell; you gain the Scent sense.
    - Environment Adaptation: choose a hostile environment; you gain an adaptation that allows you to survive this environment.
      For example, you might choose to survive in extreme cold, and thus gain a blubber layer.
    - Motion-Sensitivity: your vision becomes very sensitive to motion.
      You gain +10 to Perception tests made against moving targets.
    - Sprinter: choose one movement mode and increase it by +1/+3 (for example, Walking 4/12 would become Walking 5/15).
    - Thick Hide: You gain +1 armor.
- *Fast-Healing*: you have Fast Healing 1

#### Optional Trait: Animal Form.

Some shifters, in addition to their *hybrid* form, can entirely assume the form of an animal.

- **Effect**: you can assume the form of an animal.
  - Your animal form resembles a normal member of the animal that your hybrid form was based on.
  - Your animal form can’t be too large (as large as an elephant, larger than size Large) or too small (as small as a cricket, smaller than size Small).

#### Optional Trait: Enhanced Hybrid Form

- **Effect**: you can choose two more benefits for your Hybrid Form.

## Uncommon races

### Clay Men

The Clay Men have long dwelled deep underground; they are among the most unusual races of the Emerald Plane.
Explorers from the Commonwealth first contacted them more than six hundred years ago; though they where open enough to trade and cooperation, their isolation deep underground limited how much traffic was possible.

Despite being open and sociable, their extremely long lives and alien natures made them slow to seek closer alliance with others races and nations.
They have long suffered from attacks from the *Leapers*, who seem to be attempting to exterminate them.
When the Deep-Explorer Dwarves began to venture underground, the Clay Men allied with them against their mutual enemy—although the highly individualist Deep-Explorers have remained wary of the Clay Men, given that, like the Mind-Sharing Dwarves, the Clay Men blend their minds.
More recently, as large number of Kobolds have settled in the Commonwealth, the Clay Men have also begun to contact and trade with these (relatively) shallow-dug creatures.

As the Commonwealth prospered, as they expanded and explored further and further underground, and as they made major strides against the Leapers and their vassals, the Clay Men came to view them both more as an enlightened nation in which the Clay Men might be welcomed and respected despite their extreme differences, and as vital military allies against their mutual and deadly foes.
When the Commonwealth Compact was signed in CY 750, the Clay Men where one of several long-time allies who became formal signatories and members.

#### Alien Nature

The Clay Men have a unique nature.
They do not have organs and tissues the way that most other races do; instead, they are a mass of living, undifferentiated material.
Without bones or organs, they have a great ability to stretch, compress and reshape themselves; they can also extend *pseudopods* for grip and locomotion.
They do not have eyes and are completely blind, but they have exceptional senses of hearing and vibration—which serve them better than eyes in the lightless depths where they live.

Perhaps more remarkable—or more enviable—to surface dwellers, they are fueled at least in part by magic.
They need very little food, they do not sleep, and they do not age.

Even more amazing is their ability to literally *blend*.
Two Clay Men can extend pseudopods and partly *blend together*.
While blending, Clay Men can share, copy and exchange their minds, and can support one another if one is enjured or strained.

#### Clay Culture

Many of their communities center arund *reservoirs*—large masses of the living material that makes up Clay Men.
Unlike individual Clay Men, reservoirs aren't sentient or active in themselves; instead, reservoirs act as repositories.
Clay Men can *blend* with the reservoir, storing bits of themselves with in—or accessing the stored minds and experiences of others.
Clay Men cannot copy their entire, living minds into a reservoir, but they can preserve a remarkable ammount of their memories, skills, personalities and knowledge.

Unsurprisingly, many "Clay" communities center around the care (and defence) of these reservoirs, and the cultivation of useful skills and knowledge within.

This gives many Clay Men a unique outlook.
The reservoir gives them a measure of immortality—beyond even that provided by the fact that they do not age.
It also allows them to modify their minds in a way that few other races can; they can quite literally retrieve bits of knowledge or even personality from the reservoir, to suppliment or replace their own.
For this reason, some Clay Men are disposed to think of themselves as much as realizations of some of the minds stored with their reservoir as individuals themselves.

Notably, Clay Men seem to have extremely flexible and adaptive natures.
Clay Men have experimented with using magical and chemical means to alter physical forms.
Different communities sport different adaptations, which make their members suitable to different tasks; some can breath water and swim, for example, while others can exude caustic chemicals to tunnel through solid rock.
Recently, some Clay Men have experimented with developing a bony "rigging" internally, the better to operate on the surface among the other races of the Commonwealth.

Since they are not dependant on wide, cultivated fields, and since they do not age or die naturally, their communites tend to be small, and to grow very slowly if they grow at all.
Their communities are also heavily fortified and defended, to resist the Leapers.

Clay Men speak a unique language (simply called "clay") that makes use of very low frequencies—which most other races cannot hear or produce.

#### Commonwealth Integration

The Clay Men lagged behind the rest of the Commonewalth in architecture and mettallurgy, although they possess a sophisticated understandings of magic and medicine.
More practically, they have proved a fruitful source of minerals, metals, and rare materials from deep underground.

Notably, most of what the Commonwealth knows about the Leapers, they have learned from the Clay Men.
(Whatever secrets the Deep-Divers know, they have largely chosen not to share.)

Clay Men have a very distinctive vocalization range; while they can produce both very low and very high-pitched sounds, they struggle to produce complex patterns.
Most of them speak a local variant of the same root language, simply called "clay".
They can learn to speak Commonwealth Standard (though members of some other races find it painful to listent to for long periods of time).

#### Clay-Men Vitals

An ancient, amorphous race.

- Old Age: -
- Average Height: 1.8m
- Average Weight: 50kg
- Diet: Omnivore

- DUR 35, STR 20
- \+5 INT, \+5 SAV, \+5 WIL
- Movement: Burrow 3/9, Pseudopods 3/9, Roll 4/12/24
- Senses: Echo-Sight, Mage Sight, Tremor Sense
- Tags: Supernatural, Shape-Shifter, Amorphous, Clay Men
- Language Groups: CM
- *Amorphous*: Clay Men are amorphous, and can manipulate their shape
at will; they can stretch, narrow, ball up, flatten out, and so on.
  - This has many benefits: they can slip through very small openings, flatten themselves over surfaces, or roll into a ball to roll; they are also nearly impossible to tie down or grapple.
  - They do not have enough control to *mimic* an object (or creature)—except possibly a giant mass of cookie dough.
  - Notably, they cannot practically wear armor.
  - *Cavities*: Clay Men can hollow out *cavities*, which allows them to store (and manipulate) objects within themselves.
  - *Pseudopods*: Clay Men can extend *pseudopods*.
    Most can extend up to four *pseudopods*, of about a meter length.
  - *Ripples*: clay men can create creases, ripples, dimples, "cups", and other small features; this allows them to grip surfaces and manipulate small objects.
- *No Organs*: Clay Men do not have vital organs (or, indeed, differentiated tissues), and thus they are not vulnerable to attacks or powers that rely on targeting weak points or vital organs.
  - They have Resistance: Precision (Immunity), and critical hits against them are *downgraded*.
- *No Facing*: Clay Men have no particular “front” or facing (and no discrete sensory organs).
  They can perceive all around themselves, including directly above and below.
- *No Bones*: Lacking a skeletal structure, Clay Men cannot take advantage of *leverage*; this severely reduces their ability to deploy their strength.
  - Their DB is 0.
  - They suffer a -30 penalty on checks where *leverage* would be required.
- *Blind*: Clay Men have most of the senses that other races do—taste, touch, smell and hearing—but they are *blind*.
- *Acute Hearing*: Clay men have an incredible sense of hearing, stemming from their abilit to use their entire surface to detect sound.
  They gain a +20 bonus to auditory perception checks, and can hear both very low and very high pitches of sound.
- *Envelop*: Clay Men have a unique form of physical combat available to them: simply enveloping (and then digesting) an enemy; this works much like *grappling*, except that the grappled creature is pulled completely inside the Clay Man.
  - Enveloped targets are normally held immobile; but, if the enveloped creature succeeds on a STR+SOM check, they can deal damage to the Clay Man that has enveloped them with any weapon they are holding (or any natural weapon).
  - A Clay Man can begin to *digest* a creature that it has enveloped; this deals 1d10÷2 DV per turn.
- *Fast Healing*: Clay Men have Fast Healing 1
- *Fueled by Magic*: Clay Men have internal magical process that help to keep them going.
  They need to breath (by exchanging oxygen through their surface).
  They need to eat to grow, but they need little food when not growing or repairing damage.
  They do not need to sleep.
  They can be effected by disease, but are resistant to most diseases that affect humanoids (they have Resistance: Disease (+30 to checks to resist)).
  They do not age.
- *Blend*: Clay-Men can *blend* with *reservoirs* and with other Clay Men, joining their minds and bodies.
  Though the *blended* Clay-Men retain their separate identities, they gain a profound level of access to each-other's minds.
  They can communicate; exchange thoughts, ideas and information; and access one-another's skills and memories.
  They can even exchange or copy elements of one-another's minds.

#### Optional Background: Clay-Man Community

The character hails from one of the Clay-Men's subterranean communities.

- 10 ranks in Control
- 10 ranks in Spellcraft
- 10 ranks in any *Technical* skill
- A racial optional trait

Most members of Clay-Men Communities speak a local variant of *Clay* (CM).
The *Unique Outlook* trait is common, usually for *resistance to stress related to personal death*.

#### Optional Trait: Aquatic

Some Clay-Men have adapted themselves to aquatic environments.

- **Effect**: the character can breath under water, and gains the *Swim 4/12* movement mode.

#### Optional Trait: Caustic

Some Clay-Men have developed the ability to suffose all or part of themselves with caustic chemicals, which allows them to dissolve objects that they touch (or envelop).

- **Effect**: the character can make all or part of themselves *caustic*, which allows them to *dissolve* (and, optionally, *digest*) anything that they are in contact with (or have enveloped).
  - Objects or creatures in contact with a *caustic* Clay Man take 1d10÷2 DV per turn.
  - This increases the damage that they deal to an *enveloped* creature or object to 1d10 DV per turn.
  - They can make all, part or none of themselves caustic; they can, for example, render only a small patch of their surface *caustic*.
  - This makes it easier for them to burrow, which improves the rate of the *Burrow* movement to 4/12.
  - *Caustic* Clay Men can tunnel even through solid rock—although they are slowed to 2/6 when doing so.

#### Optional Trait: Color-Changing

Some Clay-Men can alter their coloration.

- **Effect**: the character can change their surface coloration.
  This allows them to create *shapes* or *patterns* down to the scale of a few centimeters, which allows them to display text or rudimentary images; to decorate themselves; to make themselves easy to spot (+20 to Perception checks); or camouflage themselves (+20 to Stealth).

#### Optional Trait: Eye-Spots

Some Clay Men have developed *eye-spots* on their surface, which gives them the ability to see.
The eye-spots don't have *lenses*, so each individual eye-spot has poor vision; information from all of them must be combined to build an image of the Clay Man's surroundings.

- **Effect**: the character has developed eye-spots on their surface.
  - The character gains the *Normal* and *Infrared* senses, and looses the *Blind* trait.
  - Visual perception checks have a -20 penalty.
  - Clay Men can percieve all around them their vision, just like with their other senses (as per the *No Facing* racial trait).

#### Optional Trait: Rigging

Some Clay-Men can produce an internal *skeleton*, which allows them to use internal leverage to better deploy their strength.

- **Effect**: the character can produce an internal support structure made of cartilage.
  - They can produce and dissolve the “rigging” at will.
  Creating the rigging is a Task Action with a six hour timeframe, and dissolving it is Task Action with a three-hour timeframe.
  - The rigging allows the Clay Man to take advantage of internal leverage, and thus negates the *No Bones* trait; it also increases their STR by 5.
  - However, the cartilage is fragile, and it exposes the character to bits of tiny broken cartilage tumbling through them when they are injured.  The cartilage reduces their DUR by 5.

#### Optional Trait: Sticky

Some Clay Men have adapted themselves to become *sticky*.

- **Effect**: the character can make all or part of themselves *sticky*.
  - This allows the character to easily grab onto surfaces and objects.
  - This provides the character with a +20 bonus to checks made to *grapple* or *envelop* characters.
  - The character gains the *Climbing 4/12* movement mode.

### Dwarves

Short but sturdy, Dwarves hail from the cold and snowy north.
Only about a third of the Dwarven Holds have signed the Commonwealth Charter, while the others remained independent.
A few adventurous Commonwealth dwarves travelled west with the Commonwealth, where they have dug holds in the Haven Isles, besides Ash Elves and Kobolds, and prospered.

#### Traditional Dwarven Culture

Dwarves originate in the frozen north, where the low peaks and rolling foothills of the Worldspine Mountains give way to the coast, the ocean, and the forested plains to their east and west.
Dwarves have long been comfortable living underground, surrounded by growing things: many of their ancient communities consisted of small numbers of bermed buildings in the relative flatlands of the northeast, or of structures dug into the foothills of the Worldspine—many small Dwarven communities built on the surface still consist largely of bermed buildings.
As Dwarves began to urbanize, their earthen construction became larger and deeper; the development of sophisticated mining and masonry techniques allowed them to incorporate stone into their construction and to build underground, eventually producing the Dwarven clan-holds that were common when the Empire of Man first contacted them.

Most modern Dwarven holds are large, wide, sturdy structures built of stone and earthwork; they are often dug shallowly, with substantial extent on the surface (as opposed to deeper-digging races like Kobolds, who often build entirely subterranean structures deep underground).
Dwarven Holds are often built in a ring around the base of a hill; more rarely, they may be dug into open ground, or partially dug into the slope of a mountain.
They often feature large open spaces on the interior, which provide ventilation, and serve as public spaces or gardens.

The old Dwarven culture of the North is centered around kin and custom.
Most Dwarven holds will be controlled by a Clan, consisting of several families—though some large holds may be governed by several Clans, and some large and wealth Clans control multiple holds.
Rather than law and governance as such, holds tend to be run by custom and consensus; authority is typically held by the heads of families.
Similarly, exchange is more often mediated by custom than currency, and there is a strong emphasis on caring for kin.

Dwarves are open enough and are rarely hostile, although they can be insular; it can be extremely difficult for an outsider to find a place in such a family-oriented society.
For this reason, only about a third of the Dwarven Clans of the north ever signed the Commonwealth Charter; the others have remained independent.

Dwarves have cultivated expertise in mining, stonework and agriculture.
Craftsmen also hold high status in Dwarven holds, and many Dwarven communities are known for the quality of the work of their artisans, which can rival the work of Human craftsmen.


#### Haven Isles Dwarves

Though only a few Dwarves chose to leave their northern lands and settle elsewhere in the Commonwealth, the communities founded by these travellers, explorers and exiles have endured, grown and prospered.
Today, Dwarves are one of the most common races in the huge urban centers of the Haven Isles in particular, where their own culture blends with their Kobold and Ash-Elf neighbors.

The Dwarves of the Haven Isles tend to be more mercantile; formal law and finance have substantially replaced tradition and custom in these communities.
Though some view this as a loss, it has made these communities far more open and accessible to outsiders; the Dwarves of the Haven Isles welcome guests, travelers and traders.

The Dwarves of the Haven Isles tend to get along particularly well with their Kobold neighbors, whose boisterous, zealous and optimistic nature are often welcome; these friendships can often be bittersweet, as Dwarves live much longer lives than Kobolds.
It is not unusual for one Dwarf to have a close and vital friendship with several generations of a Kobold family.

While many of these Dwarven populations reside in Holds dug into the peaks of the Haven Isles beside Ash Elves and Kobolds, several Dwarven clans have settled in the trading-cities and harbors of the Haven Isles' coast.
These "shipwright" Dwarves have come to cooperate closely with the Ratfolk, Halfling and Orcish shipwrights who have helped to build the Commonwealth's navy.

#### Mindsharing Dwarves

In CY 509, Dwarven explorers discovered a strange, psionically active fungus beneath the low peak of a small island in the northern Haven Isles.
The fungus proved to have remarkable capabilities, and an entirely new Dwarven culture has developed around it.
This organism is called "Fahra" in Hud, which is derived from "Fehr," or fungus; Clans that have accepted the organism as a symbiot are called Fahrat Clans.
The Common word for the organism is "Mindshare Fungus," which is an apt description of what it does.

Mindshare Fungus can thrive on its own in the damp dark of caves beneath the Emerald Plane as well as any other fungus can, but it also has the ability to derive nourishment from the magical energies of living creatures—what is commonly called psionic energy.
What's more, the fungus can actually colonize the bodies of some other creatures—including Dwarves, whose physiology is highly compatible with it.
Mindshare Fungus is not a parasite, however, but rather a symbiote; it does not harm its hosts, but it does provide them with some remarkable benefits.
The Mindsharing Fungus can "bridge" the minds of its hosts; this allows those hosts to exchange thoughts, experiences, knowledge, and even skills.
These exchanges are largely voluntary; hosts have a great deal of control over what they share with others and what they take in—although they cannot completely shut out the connection.

Normally, this effect only works over short distances—hosts need to be within a few *strides* of each-other to bridge their minds.
However, the effect can be "conducted" over greater distance by Mindsharing Fungus "plants" themselves—and these "plants" can be quite large, with many different surface growths connected by a vast rootwork.
Mindshare "plants" also have the remarkable ability to *store* and *retrieve* parts of the minds of users—ranging from simple messages or discrete memories to fragments of personalities.

A unique, highly communal culture has sprung up around the *Fahra*.
The Mindsharing Dwarves tend to be radically open, honest and egalitarian.
Even more than traditional Dwarves, they run their societies by consensus and memory—thanks to the Mindsharing Fungus, they have little need of courts, contracts, physical records, or even schools.
Members of Mindsharing communities will often share some personality traits—an individual's personality is never forcefully changed, as even Mindsharing Dwarves value their individuality, but rather occurs naturally and inevitably as the mind of each member slightly overlaps with every other in a community.
Some communities remain highly individualistic in their own way, where each member lives their own lives and pursues their own goals, merely using the *Fahra* to best live at peace with their neighbors; in other communities, however, members can begin to "vanish" into the collective.

No Mindsharing community has been known to forcefully recruit a member, or force its will on a member; this is due in part to their culture, in part to Commonwealth law, and in part to the fact that the trauma and misery inflicted on that individual would "leak" over the link—no matter how much they might try to stop it—and would "poison" all the other members.
Still, there are those that fear them.

Most Mindsharing Dwarves live in the Haven Isles.
A few have resettled in their traditional homeland, building a few Holds in the northeast of the Worldspine mountains; their distant kin have greeted them cooly (an understatement in the case of the Deep-Explorer Dwarves).

#### Deep-Explorer Dwarves

Deep-Explorer Dwarves are a Dwarven subculture that has vanished into the depths, substantially withdrawing from the affairs of surface-dwellers and "shallow diggers".
The Deep-Explorer Dwarves' origins lie in the *Lun*, a confederation of Dwarven holds in the northeastern peaks of the Worldspine mountains.
Independent and individualistic, they where not among the holds that joined the Commonwealth.
In CY 514, a community of Dwarves from the Haven Isles settled in an abandoned Hold near the territory of the *Lun*; these Dwarves had brought the *Fahra* with them, and began to culture and experiment with the symbiotic organism.

The fiercely individualistic *Lun* where horrified; they feared what their new neighbors might become, and were particularly alarmed that their hold was in a position to close off the *Lun*'s path out of the Worldspine Mountains.
The *Lun* sought a refuge that the *Fahrat* could never breach, and a path of escape that they could never cut off; they began digging deeper underground in CY 517, and by CY 533 they had almost entirely withdrawn from the surface—their former settlements where now little more than heavily-fortified trading-posts.

Today, little is known about the Deep-Explorer Dwarves—called the *Drahrat* in their own language, a deliberate dig at the *Fahrat*.

See also *Deep-Explorer Dwarves* in *Other Factions*.

#### Optional Background: Dwarven Hold

You hail from a Dwarven Hold, either in the north of the Emerald Plane or one of the mountainous islands of the Haven Isles.

- 10 ranks in two Technical skills
- 10 ranks in Protocol
- 10 ranks in Barter

#### Optional Trait: Cave-Eyes

Some Dwarves eyesight has become extremely sensitive; this allows them very good vision in dim light, but it also makes them very sensitive to bright light.
This is extremely common among the *Drahrat*, most of whom cannot venture in daylight without day-masks (see below).

- You gain the *Low-Light* sense.
- You become highly sensitive to bright light; your are dazzled in bright light (such as daylight), suffering a -30 penalty to visual perception tests.
- Prolonged exposure to bright light is increasingly painful, eventually causing permanent damage to your vision.

#### Cultural Item: Day-Mask (Cost: Medium or Cost: Hight)

The *Day-Mask* consists of smoked lenses designed to filter out bright light, as well as a fabric or leather wrap that attaches them to the head.
The wrap is used to completely enclose the eyes, preventing light from "leaking" around the edges of the lenses; leather and wool are common in the north, while lighter fabrics (often dyed dark colors) are used in the south.

- You do not suffer any penalty from exposure to bright light (such as from the Cave-Eyes trait).
- You suffer a -10 penalty to visual perception checks.
- You suffer a -10 penalty in dim light.
- Normal Day-Masks are Cost: Medium

The lenses of some Day-Masks are *ground*, with different sections having different shapes.
This may be done to correct for poor vision, or may provide magnification at long or short range.

- *Ground* Day-Masks provide a +10 bonus to visual perception checks.
- *Grinding* a Day-Mask is Cost: Medium (in addition to the cost of the Day Mask).

Some Day-Masks are magical; their lenses are crystal-clear in dim light, but rapidly "smoke over" when exposed to bright light.

- Magical Day-Masks protect your eyes from bright light the way normal Day-Masks do, but they impose none of the penalties that normal Day-Masks have.
- The lenses "smoke over" in little more than a second.  If you are suddenly exposed to bright light, you may experience some dazzling (incuring a -10 penalty to visual perception tests), but this fades quickly (lasting only for the first turn of exposure).
- You can force the Day-Mask to become clear or smoked.
- Magical Day-Masks are usually *ground* (at no additional cost).
- Magical Day-Masks are Cost: High.

#### Cultural Item: Day-Wrap

Dwarves who cannot afford a Day-Mask—or who must do without one for some other reason—often use a *wrap* like a large bandanna; there are different ways to wear the *day-wrap*, but it is usually worn so that it shades the face and eyes.
\[Dwarven day-wraps are much like *shemaghs*.\]

Some day-wraps may be woven in complex patterns or richly died; many Clans and Holds have specific patterns and colors.

- When wearing a day-wrap—or improvising a similar covering—the penalty for exposure to bright light is reduced to -20.
- Day-wraps work by shading the eyes from the sun; they are ineffective against lights at eye-level.
- Day-Wraps are Cost: Trivial

#### Cultural Item: Deep-Explorer's Knife

*This weapon is a variant weapon.  It is similar to the Longsword, but deals slightly more one-handed damage (and slightly less two-handed damage), and gains Well Suited: Mighty Blow (and soak) in echange for Poorly Suited: Strike Armor Gap.*

Many Deep-Explorers weild a characteristic sword designed for use from salamander-back in close quarters.
They are long, broad-bladed, have a single cutting edge and are weighted towards the far end.
Although the grip is slightly small for it, the Deep-Explorer's Knife can also be wielded in two hands for better leverage.

Tags: One-handed, Two-handed, Bladed, Close, Difficult, Heavy, Soak, Poorly Suited: Strike Armor Gap, Well Suited: Mighty Blow

Damage: 1d10+5+DB (one-handed), 2d10-1+DB (two-handed)

AP: 2

#### Cultural Item: Repeating Crossbow

Deep-Explorer Dwarves use a type of repeating crossbow designed to exploit their access to exotic venoms and perform well in the tight, narrow, curling tunnels of their homes.
It fires rapidly by levering the firing mechanism back-and-forth under the stock; it stores bolts in a "hopper" on top of the weapon, and uses their own weight to feed them; and it re-stringing the bow on the backstroke.
While this mechanism cannot draw the bow to any great weight, it can be used to rapidly fire a hail of bolts.

These weapons are short-barreled and low-powered; instead of the high-damage and effective armor-penetration of other crossbows, they rely on volume of fire and poisoned bolts for effectiveness.

Tags: Two-handed, Ranged, Prone, Reload, Rapid-Fire, Soak

Damage 1D10+1

AP: 2

Reload: Quick Action per bolt

Special: Magazine.  Repeating Crossbows have a fixed *hopper* or *magazine* on top of the weapon.
Bolts are placed into the top of the box to load the weapon, and their own weight causes them to fall through the bottom into the weapon.  In effect, the crossbow reloads itself from the *hopper* as it fires, and the user need only reload the *hopper* after it is empty.  The magazines typically have a capacity of 10 bolts.

Special: The weapon continues to fire as long as the catch is depressed.
The bolt can be "tapped" to fire a single bolt, given a *short* squeeze to fire several bolts, or held down to fire all the bolts in the magazine.

When firing the crossbow, choose wether to *tap* the trigger, give it a *short squeeze*, or *empty the magazine*, and use the following modifiers:

- a *tap* first a single bolt and functions normally.
- a *short* squeeze uses up to 3 bolts; if all three are fired, deals \+1d10 DV, and gains +10 to the attack check.
- a *long* squeeze uses up to 10 bolts; if at least five are fired, deals \+3d10 DV, and gains +20 to the attack check.

#### Optional Trait: Mind-Sharing

You have a *Fahra* symbiote; this allows you to share parts of your mind with other Mind-Sharing Dwarves nearby, and for them to share their minds with you.

- You can *share your mind* with anyone else with the Mind-Sharing trait who is within 15m.
  - The Mind-Sharing Fungus serves as something of a conductor; if a Mind-Sharing Fungus is within range, then you can *share your mind* with anyone else with the Mind-Sharing trait who is within range of the same *Mind-Sharing Fungus*.
  - Note that many funguses are quite large; what may appear to be many different growths on the surface may actually all be parts of one huge plant, with a vast root-system.
- *Sharing your mind* provides several benefits:
  - you can communicate, as though speaking;
  - you can share a sense-perception (i.e. allowing someone to see through your eyes);
  - you can share memories (i.e. allowing someone to perceive your memories as you do);
  - you can share knowledge;
  - you can share your skills (if you have 30 or more ranks in a skill, then you can grant someone access to your skill; they are treated as if they have 15 ranks in that skill);
  - you can even "fortify" someone else's mind (if you have a rating of 25 or more in an aptitude, then you can "fortify" that aptitude in someone else; they are treated as having a rating of 15 in that aptitude).
- Being connected with the minds of others can cause some of your personality to blend with their, and vice-versa.
  - This effect is subtle, only occurs over the long-term, and is intended to be role-played; even in its most extreme form, it does not *require* a character to "loose themselves" to those they are sharing their mind with.

#### Optional Background: Mind-Sharing Dwarf

You are from a community of Mind-Sharing Dwarves.

- the Mind-Sharing trait.
- 10 ranks in Control
- 10 ranks in Protocol
- 10 ranks in one Technical skill

#### Optional Background: Deep-Explorer Dwarf

You are a *Drahrat*—called a "Deep-Explorer" in the Commonwealth.
You are from a member of a secretive culture that has vanished deep underground.

- 10 ranks in Ride
- 10 ranks in Survival
- 10 ranks in one Technical skill
- a Survival skill-kit, specialized for caves.
- one other skill-kit

The Cave-Eyes trait is very common, as are *day-wraps*.

Since the secrets of the Deep-Explorer Dwarves are left up to your GM, you should consult with them before deciding to play one; they may leave it up to you to describe the culture that your character is from, they might have plans for the Deep-Explorers that you will need to account for, or they may not allow you to play a Deep-Explorer at all.

### Gnomes

  - Gnomes live in burrows in the lower ranges of the World Spine
    Mountains.

  - Gnome burrows reside near the surface; they are “burried shallow,”
    with surface entrances.

  - Gnome communities tend to be small; a dozen families or fewer,
    spread across as many burrows.

  - Gnomish communities tend to be isolated; they are not eager to
    receive guests, not even other Gnomes.

  - The outsiders they deal most frequently with are Kobolds, from
    burrows dug deeper underground in the World Spine Mountains.

  - Gnome communities tend to be *idiosyncratic*, owing to their limited
    outside contact.

  - Gnomish culture can blend the hedonic and the materialistic in
    strange ways. Because their communities are small and isolated, they
    are used to suffering hardship and want; however, they are also
    highly pleasure-seeking in their own way, and tend to be highly
    libertine and indulgent in the pursuit of mortal pleasure (when they
    have the opportunity).

  - As a result, they may appear to be humble, simple and rustic—until
    evening descends, when the party drugs come out.

### Halflings

  - Halflings were one of the founding races of the Commonwealth.

  - Halflings have a somewhat unique dimorphic society; the young and
    hardy travel in Caravans, trading wares and selling their skills,
    while children, the infirm and the elderly live in fixed
    settlements.

  - Halfling communities tend to form close, symbiotic relationships
    with Gnollish villages and families. Halfling communities are
    frequently built near Gnollish towns and villages; they depend on
    the Gnolls for security and labor, and the Gnolls depend on the
    Halfling caravans to sell their produce.

  - In particular, Gnolls commonly travel with Halfling caravans,
    providing security—and services like smithing, for which Halflings
    are poorly suited.

  - Caravans of Halfling traders and Gnollish guards knitted together
    the early Commonwealth, and remain on of its most iconic elements—if
    distant kindgoms know nothing else about the Commonwealth, they know
    about the trade caravans, and might have been visited by one.

  - Halflings have not grown at the rate that the other races have
    grown, and other forms of trade—notably mediated by ships sailing
    along major rivers, and along the coasts—have eclipsed the Caravans
    in the ability to move goods. Because of this, the fortunes of
    Halflings have fallen somewhat.

  - Still, the Caravans remain numerous, and are a vital carrier of
    Commonwealth trade.

#### Optional Background: Caravaneer

- 10 ranks in Barter
- 10 ranks in one Technical skill
- one Skill Kit
- one Halfling Wagon
- two horses

#### Cultural Item: Halfling Caravan Cart (Cost: High)

Halfling Wagons are large horse-drawn carts that serve as both a mobile residence, work-space and shop for a Halfling businessperson (and possibly some business-partners or family).

The carts varied; the humblest is essentially a discarded human wagon with bunks hung from boards running along the sides as walls, while the most expensive are large, wood-sided structures whose internal spaces are divided into floors and rooms (though small even by the standards of Halflings).
Some are even designed to be opened up, becoming small shops once set up.

In general, a Halfling Wagon can comfortably accomodate up to four halflings, and provide work space enough to carry and use (when stopped and set-up) a Shop.
Halflings Wagons are neither light nor fast; the are two-axled, and are most often pulled by two horses.

### Herders

  - Herders are tall, thin and *roughly* humanoid—besides the layer of
    short fur, the large, deer-like eyes, the antlers and the hooves.

  - They are also *extremely* fast, and more than a little skittish.

  - The Herder where a tribal society that existed in the far West of
    the Emerald Plane.

  - Though distant from the Shade Elves, they were still within their
    reach, because the Shade Elves where commonly mounted and could
    strike far to the North.

  - The Herders formed an alliance with several other nearby tribal
    cultures, including a tribal Gnollish culture, for defense against
    the Shade Elves.

  - They were first encountered by the Commonwealth in CY 255, and
    peaceful relations where established.
    
      - Between 341 an 344, the Shade Elves heavily raided both
        Commonwealth and Herder settlements; the two allied, and
        successfully devastated the Shade Elf raiders.
      - In CY 349, the Herders signed a treaty with the Commonwealth,
        becoming allies; when the Compact was ratified, the Herders
        formally became members of the Commonwealth.

  - Herders are very social creatures; the live in large settlements in
    the open, grassy plains and gentle hills of the far West of the
    Emerald Plane.
    
      - Though they are a primitive tribal society, they cannot digest
        meat efficiently, and so they practice agriculture—using inlets
        cut from rivers to irrigate grain fields and orchards. Check
        that this makes some sense.
      - They often hunt and trap, as much for the sake of pelt,
        tradition and trade as to feed themselves
      - Their settlements are often situated near rivers, and they farm
        and fish.
      - Many of their settlements are still walled, owing to the
        continued risk of Shade Elf raids, even to the present day—and
        despite the heavy presence in the region of Commonwealth guards.

  - They are a traditional and somewhat insular people, and show little
    interest in trade or exchange with the wider Commonwealth.

  - They make excellent archers, and are extremely quick over open
    terrain, which can make them frustrating opponents for Shade Elves,
    and valuable allies for other nearby tribes (and partners for tribal
    gnolls specifically).

#### Vitals

Quick, dextrous, sociable and peaceful – but also weak and frail.
They tend to be wary of outsiders, and are dangerous at range.

### Orcs

  - Centuries ago, 165 years before the first Commonwealth Charter, orcs
    founded cities in the snowy Northern reaches far to the West of the
    World-Spine Mountain.
    
      - The oldest Orcish lands are located on a large, flat peninsula
        in the North-Western reaches of the Emerald Plane, separated
        from Dwarven lands by a gulf.
      - They were a tribal society: extended Families allied into Clans,
        and several Clans might cooperate to found a city.

  - They were a warlike honor-society
    
      - Orcs are large and have poor reflexes; they made poor riders,
        and so they marched to war on foot. Because of this, and their
        fractious nature, they rarely mustered large armies and marched
        to war.
      - They had ample access to sea and river; their clans built many
        small, shallow-draft long-boats, and they were terrifying
        raiders up and down the nearby coasts.
      - Threat of invasion, and promise of relief from raiding, were
        used to force other nearby societies to pay tribute; Orcs
        typically raided distant seaport cities, and the clans often
        warred among themselves.
      - For conflicts within their society, they used a system of
        ritualized combat.
      - The period before contact with the Commonwealth represents a
        golden age for the orcs, a period of wealth and power—and a time
        of misery for their neighbors.

  - Humans of the Old Empire avoided Orcish lands, using their
    tributaries as a buffer.

  - Centuries later, in CY 91, the Commonwealth began to spread west of
    the World-Spine, incorporating former Imperial human settlements and
    tribes (when willing) alike.
    
      - In CY 113, the Commonwealth allowed a tribe of Elves who the
        Orcs had claimed as tributaries to join; thereafter, the Elves
        stopped paying tribute, and the orcs sacked them.
      - This led the Commonwealth to lay siege to the Orcish clan-hold
        that launched the attack.
      - Other Orcish cities marshaled an army and attempted to break the
        siege; their attempt failed.
      - This led to 20 years of warfare between the Commonwealth; the
        Orcs were significantly outmatched by the Commonwealth military,
        and most of their tributaries were liberated. By CY 131, they
        were left with no tributaries, and were surrounded by
        Commonwealth settlements and Commonwealth-allied tribes.
      - The Commonwealth also began to fortify the coast and
        river-front; though expensive for the Commonwealth to construct,
        this effectively prevented Orc raiding, as their small and
        mobile raiding parties could not carry the means to break
        fortifications.

  - There followed a time of misery; without the tribute they depended
    on and unable to profitably raid, their society fell into decline.
    
      - They were riven by internal conflict, as individuals, families
        and clans battled over what wealth and power remained.
      - The Orcish population underwent a contraction, and their cities
        and roads suffered great neglect and decay.

  - A generation or Orcs grew up in misery, look out at the prosperous
    Commonwealth. Some went to explore it; on returning, they carried
    back stories of a prosperous, diverse society.
    
      - In CY 154, the orc Odna returned from exploring the
        Commonwealth, and began to advocate for a radical course:
        joining the Commonwealth and subscribing to their laws.
      - In CY 155, he challenged first his own clan head, and then a
        champion of the clans of his city; he won both challenges, and
        on behalf of his city and its clans, signed the Commonwealth
        Charter; thus did the city of Akala become the first Orcish city
        to join the Commonwealth.
      - Access to the Commonwealth’s markets greatly eased the misery of
        Akala; seeing their success, other movements in other clan-holds
        also sought to join the Commonwealth.

  - Today, Orcs have been members of the Commonwealth for almost 700
    years.
    
      - Orcish culture struggled to adapt itself to Commonwealth law and
        tradition: today, it is a blend of traditional Orcish elements,
        imports from the rest of the Commonwealth and uniquely Orcish
        innovations.
      - Their views on the Commonwealth and their place within it are
        complex. Though they take pride in being members of an ascendant
        and prosperous people, they also remember how they came to be
        members in it—the most traditional among their numbers claim
        that they were conquered, and that they still bear the shame of
        it.
      - Honor continues to be highly valued in Orcish society. Though
        most have taken the view that great works and labors are
        achievements worthy of honor and glory, the most traditional
        still believe that victory in combat is the greatest honor.
      - Though some orcs remain within their ancient borders and
        practice a (modified) version of their traditions, others travel
        the wider world seeking honor and accomplishment (and to bring
        wealth home, since Orcish communities still do not have adequate
        farming).
      - Unsurprisingly, many Orcs seek honor and recognition in the
        Commonwealth military. Orcs are very strong, and so many seek
        work as laborers and artisans—notably, Orcish cities boast
        impressive architecture. Orcs are also very clever, and some
        seek honor and achievement in the Commonwealth’s universities
        (Orcish scholars are generally not known for being nurturing and
        understanding mentors).
      - Notably, many Elvish communities exist near Orcish ones. Most
        orcs and elves have good relations, as they are both tribal
        cultures and have long lived near each other—for most, their
        time of conflict is centuries past and forgotten. Still, a few
        of the most traditional—in both communities—continue to nurse
        ancient grudges.

  - The Orcish people can claim 6 major cities: five are their
    traditional cities, and the sixth was established on the
    Commonwealth’s border with the Shade Elves. Of the orcs five
    traditional cities, three are members of the Commonwealth, and the
    remaining two are not.
    
      - When dealing with each other, orcs use their ancient customs,
        and orcs come and go between the Commonwealth and independent
        cities freely.
      - As a historical note, the city of Tonilac changed hands once: it
        was claimed by honorable combat by independent orcs, before
        being reclaimed by the Commonwealth six years later.
      - The city of Collac is a Commonwealth-member that was built on
        the border with the Shade Elves; it is heavily fortified, and
        the orcs there skirmish constantly with the Shade Elves, their
        allies, and their subjugate peoples.
      - Notably, the island city-state of Kethal is heavily settled by
        Orcs; in times past, it was shared amicably by Orcs and Dwarves.

  - Orcs have a vibrant mythos and rich oral history.
    
      - Orcs have several mythical heroes, about whom a great many
        stories have been told.
      - A particularly common point in Orcish Myth, which many
        historians believe corresponds to an actual event, is the Great
        Plague, an event some 15 generations ago that devastated many
        Orcish communities. The Great Pleague is frequently used a
        setting for heroic adventures of Orcish myth.
      - Over the last few hundred years, Orcs have actively transcribed
        many of these stories; their large libraries filled with
        beautifully-illuminated books are points of pride for their
        community.

  - Orcs are roughly humanoid. They are tall, lean and muscular. Their
    skin is typically either green, brown, or red; most clans will have
    one skin tone that is more common among them. Orcs also have
    prominent tusks.

### Ratfolk

  - More than 500 years ago, there was one Ratfolk civilization in the
    Warren Isles, an island chain off the Southwest near the Haven
    Isles.

  - They were organized into warrens run by families, and practiced
    fishing and farming.

  - In CY 331, 20 years before the Commonwealth started to settle Islandhome, several wealthy Ratfolk warrens united and forced their neighboring to pay tribute; they became wealthy and powerful while their kin suffored.  In the following years, other Ratfolk warlords began to rise in the Warren Isles.

  - In CY 361, the Shade Elves crossed the Shaded Sea and began to heavily raid the Warren Isles.
    
      - large numbers of Ratfolk begin fleeing the Warren Isles.
      - Some travel north to the Haven Isles, where they were eventually incorporated into the Commonwealth;
      - others fled South to the Ruby Plane, where they encountered the Raptors.

  - In CY 395, the conflict between the Warren Isles Ratfolk and the Shade Elves drags to a halt; in 398, the two form a tentative alliance, creating the Shaded Sea Peoples.
  
      - It is later learned that the "alliance" was a construct of the enigmatic Leapers.
      - The Leapers had attacked the major cities of Shade Elves and the largest warrens in the Haven Isles, and had forced both the Shade Elves and Ratfolk to pay them tribute.

  - There are now 3 distinct Ratfolk cultures:
    
      - they have a large population in the Commonwealth, first in the
        Haven Isles and now spreading throughout Heartland;
      - they are one of the two founders of the Raptor’s Alliance,
        formed with the raptors to repel Shaded Sea Peoples, including
        their “cousins”;
      - the Shaded Sea Peoples, a society consisting of Ratfolk and
        Shade Elf families.

  - Natural traders and merchants; in the Commonwealth, Ratfolk tend to
    get along well with Halflings and Humans.

  - As scavengers, they also get along well with Gnolls; Ratfolk are one
    of the few species that can eat the same food.

  - Ratfolk are one of the Commonwealth’s subterranean cultures; they
    often dwell in underground burrows.

  - Though Ratfolk do maintain their own culture and tradition, they
    were heavily assimilated into the established Commonwealth culture
    that sheltered them.

  - They are comfortable in urban environments and often live beside
    other races and cultures. They are comfortable above-ground and
    underground, and often work as traders and artisans.

  - Uniquely Ratfolk settlements are often organized around warrens;
    similar to Dwarven holds, they are mixed above-ground and
    subterranean structures. They still maintain fishing and seafaring
    traditions.

  - They commonly speak Haven Isles Ratfolk (language group GR).

#### Vitals

#### Optional Background: Warren Isles Sea-Rat

The more sophisticated of the Shaded Sea People, Ratfolk are the shipwrights and sailors of the alliance.
They are still divided into Clan-oriented settlements, where each Clan consists of several family, each of which will maintain a warren and holdings.
They are loosely confederated, amongst themselves and with Shade Elves.

  Instead, they receive one dot in Shaded Sea Common and one dot in Shaded.
  They commonly speak Warren Isles Ratfolk (language group GR) natively.

#### Optional Background: Raptor’s Plane Ratfolk

- The descendants of Ratfolk who fled Southward from their
  cousins, settled on the Raptor’s Plane and ultimately allied
  with the Raptors.
- They settled on the coasts and inland jungles closest to their
  cousins, and continue to suffer heavy raiding.
- Inland, they live in large, underground settlements, carved into
  the sides of rocky foothills.
- On the shores, where burrowing is impractical, they live in a
  walled cities of a few thousand.
- Still socially-inclined and natural traders, they have opened
  trade with the Commonwealth (and have been surprised to
  encounter their distant cousins in the Commonwealth’s fleets).
- They still fish and trade along rivers and shores, although
  Shaded Sea piracy makes this dangerous.

  They usually speak Protectorate Ratfolk as a native language.

### Shamblers

  - Shamblers are spirits bound to plants.

  - They originated in the dense marshes of the Southern lowlands to the
    West of the World-Spine Mountains.

  - They were created when Father Cypress, a Great Spirit who admired
    mortals and wished to interact with them, created plants with
    internal processes that could support Spirits, and fashioned of
    himself Spirits who could dwell within them.

  - Owing to their ability to root, Shambler communities lack cleared
    fields and grazing-lands—they also tend to have an active night
    life.

  - Despite being the children of a Great Spirit associated with
    isolated, deep swamps, Shamblers can be surprisingly urbane; they
    are welcoming of outsiders, and host many artisans and traders.

  - Shamblers are inquisitive, and their ability to root makes them
    light travelers; they therefore spawn many adventurers, explorers
    and wanderers.

#### Vitals

  While rooted, Shamblers have Fast Healing 2.
  - It is a one minute Task Action to either root or unroot.
  - If a shambler roots for 1 hour (in a location with access to sunlight, in good soil), then they will not need to otherwise eat, sleep or drink for 24 hours.

### Tempters

  - shape-shifting spirit beings. Charming and suave, but also very frail.

  - They can shape shift freely.
  
  - They tend to live in urban centers among other races. Some Tempters live openly among the large cities of the Commonwealth; more almost certainly live in secret.

- Movement: Shape-Dependant (usually Foot 4/12)
- Senses: Normal, Mage-Sight
- Size: Shape-Dependant (restricted to Medium without the Master Shifter class)
- Tags: Spirit, Shape-Shifter, Tempter
- Language Group: Any
- *Appearance of Flesh*: Even though Tempters are spirits, they are bound to the nature of flesh;they have a physical form, they can be wounded and killed, they can sicken, and they need to eat, drink, breath and sleep just like mortal beings.
  - However, because they are so bound to the nature of flesh, they are not immediately obvious as spirits to those with Mage Sight.  In order for someone with Mage Sight to recognize a Tempter, a detailed examination is required; this is a 10 minute Task Action, requiring either a Search or Spellcraft check at -20.
- *Shape-Shifting*: Tempters can take the form of any medium-sized natural creature. They can control the details of their physical form as they wish, including being able to mimic specific individuals.
  - They must take the form of a *real* (in the worlf of Renaissance) creature; they can't assume the shape of any arbitrary thing they could imagine.  That is, they can, for example, appear to be a Human, a Gnoll, a Drake and so on, but they cannot appear to be a ball of arms, legs and claws.
  - They can change shape as a Standard Action.
  - They can control their shape precisely enough that they can appear to be a specific person.
    - Assuming the form of a *specific* individual requires a Disguise check at +10.
    - To competently impersonate a person whose shape they have assumed, they will still need to use the Disguise and Deception skills, but they receive a +30 and +10 bonus on these checks, respectively.
    - Obviously, they can only mimic the features of a person that they know about.  If someone has a birthmark on their lower back, but the Shifter character has never seen that person naked, then they won't know to mimic that birthmark.  And, of course, if they've never seen a person, they cannot effectively mimic them.
  - Normally, changing shape does not affect their statistics—but see the powers listed below.
- *Mimics*: Tempters can also mimic the *speech* of any race whose shape they can take, and can mimic the voice of specific individuals.
  - Much like mimicing an individual's appearance, they still need to know what that person sounds like, and they will still need to use Disguise and Deception checks to actually impersonate someone.
- *Basin*: Like other Spirits, Tempters have a Basin (see *The Supernatural*): the mental energies of other intelligent beings.

#### Optional Negative Trait: Bind

Like some Spirits, you have a *bind* (see *The Supernatural*).

- **Effect:** You have a *Bind*.
  - You should work out the details of your bind with your GM; your GM has final approval.
  - The bind should pose a real danger to you.  It must be known to at least one clerical organization in the area where you live—although it does not need to be *widely* known.

#### Optional Power: More than Form Alone

When you assume the form of a given race, you can adopt some of their nature.

- **Effect:** When you assume the form of a given race, you may choose one Aptitude in which that race has a bonus; you gain a +5 bonus to the chosen aptitude.
  - You may choose STR or DUR if that race has a higher STR or DUR than you do.

#### Optional Power: To Crawl and Soar

You can mimic the construction of other races well enough that you gain some of their biological capabilities.

- **Effect:** When you assume the form of a given race, you may choose to gain two of the following benefits:
  - One Movement Mode that race has.
  - One Sense that race has.
  - That race's *natural armor bonus* (but not more than +3).
  - One natural attack that race has.

#### Optional Class: Master Shifter

You have mastered your ability to change your shape, allowing you to push the limits of what is possible.

- **Requirement:** either the *More than Form Alone* or *To Crawl and Soar* power (or both).
- **Effect:** When you assume a new form, you may choose one of the following:
  - If you have the *More than Form Alone* power, you may choose a second aptitude to gain a bonus in, using the same rules as the first.
  - If you have the *To Crawl and Soar* power, you may choose two additional bonuses.
  - You may take the form of a race with the Empowered tag.  (Normally, you could only take the form of a Natural creature.)
  - You may take the form of a small creature.  (Normally, you could only take the form of a Medium-sized creature.)

#### Optional Class: Empath

You have extensively developed your race's empathic talents, giving you a limited ability to sense and manipulate the emotions of others.

- **Effect:** You gain the *Empath* sense.
  - This sense has a limited range—roughly 10 meters, although you may be able to read intense emotion from further away.
  - Manipulating other's emotions is a 5 Turn Task Action; it requires either a Control Check or a SAV+WIL+WIL check, and is opposed by the target's INT+WIL.  If you use your SAV+WIL+WIL then exceptional and critical successes are ignored.
  - Your ability to drive other's emotions is limited; it stops far short of allowing you to control other people, but it does allow you to bring forward or suppress specific emotions in others.

## Neighboring Races

### Brightfeathers

Brightfeathers are small, bird-like humanoids with a wide variety of richly colored plumages.
Once the sole inhabitants of the western fringe of the Ruby Plane, they were formerly a relatively isolated culture until Ratfolk began fleeing the Warren Isles to avoid the brunt of Shade Elven raids and quickly began to establish themselves in their new home.
The Ratfolk brought relatively advanced technology to the Brightfeathers, who gained the ability to sail along the coastal waters rather than attempting to traverse the dense jungles on foot or wing.
While this helped open them to others on the Plane, this also made them natural allies for the Ratfolk as they established themselves.

Initially, they were mistrusted along with the Ratfolk who had fled the Warren Isles due to their connection wth the brutal raids from the Shaded Sea Peoples, but in time the other major power in the northwestern Ruby Plane, the Raptors, came to view coexistance as essential to survival against the onslaught from the north, leading to the initial treaties which later lead to the official establishment of the Raptor Protectorate.

The Brightfeathers themselves have a rich culture, with a native language which cannot be imitated by any other known race and a complex psuedo-pictographic writing system.
Until meeting the Ratfolk, their existance had long been rather peaceful, which helps to explain their particular focus on art of almost any kind.
Creative expression is very important to them, and those who create great works are highly respected.

Their language, Songspeak, is based largely on mimicry, with many words simply consisting of an imitation of the sound of their meaning.
Additionally, much of their cultural traditions center around music and singing, with much of their history conveyed and many of their observances celebrated through song.
In the past, these songs were entirely of their own creation, but in the modern era, many Brightfeathers are fascinated with the music and languages of other cultures, leading many to seek to travel as extensively as possible to experience as many new sounds as they can.

They recieve a +10 to Athletics checks that involve gripping or climbing and have natural weapons which are wielded with Unarmed Combat (Natural Weapons), deal 1d10-1+DB, and have 0 AP.

### Elf-Human Hybrid

  - Elves and Humans are almost unique in that they are one of the few pairings of distinct races who can produce offspring together; however, doing so is not without complication.
      - These half-human, half-elven children are almost always sterile; furthermore, while they are curiously immune to many inherited diseases that humans and elves are prone to, they are vulnerable to many unique defects all their own.
      - There are two notable populations of non-sterile elven-human hybrids: the Haffa, who live primarily in a their own kingdom in the Kingdoms of Men; and the Shifter tribes living to the West of the Worldspine Mountains.
      - The Haffa are the product of great fortune, magical intervention and selective breeding.
      - The origins of the Shifters are lost to history; perhaps obviously, they have been influenced by far more exotic forces than merely having a mix of elven and human blood.  (As such, Shifters are usually regarded as a separate race, and have their own entry.)
  - “First generation” elf-human hybrids often have no culture of their own; they are often born into an elven or human culture somewhere in the Commonwealth.
      - Especially in Westward Province, Commonwealth cities and towns often develop a shared local culture with Wood Elven tribes near them.  In these areas, hybrids are a familiar site—if not precisely common, since they usually cannot reproduce themselves.
  - One of the few populations of non-sterile elf-human hybrids exists in the Kingdoms of Men: the Haffa.

- Prehensile Feet: elf-human hybrids also (usually) inherit their Elven parent’s prehensile feet, although without the robust structure that makes them resistant to injury.  While hybrids gain the benefit of prehensile feet, their feet are also fragile and apt to suffer injury (this would be likely if an Athletics check is critically failed, for example).
- Endurance: Hybrid gain a measure of the remarkable endurance of humans; they gain a +10 bonus to Feat of Endurance checks.

### Foxfire

Foxfire are race of spirits native to a large stretch of forest in the southeast Emerald Plane; in particular, they are closely associated with a fruit-tree common in that forest, similar to a peach tree.
Like Shamblers and Tempters, Foxfire are neither incomprehensible and powerful Great Spirits nor minor, flickering magical creatures; instead, they are, in some ways, rough peers to mortal races.
Notably, they do not have a Great Spirit patron or powerful ally; because of this, they are as vulnerable to mortal conquest as any other small civiliation would be.
Because of this, they have falled under the dominion of the Shaded Sea, and suffered greatly.

Foxfire are striking — and, some would say, soothing — to behold.
They are roughy bipedal in shape — they are laid out rougly like Humans and Gnolls are — but they are composed of a diffuse, softly-luminous green material, sometimes compared to an emerald fire or a swirl of luminous green smoke.
They do not have a well-defined surface, like a creature of skin or scales; instead, they are composed of a slightly deiffuse, thick material.
This material resists objects the further "in" they go; in order for them to grip or push something, the object must "submerge" slightly, to a depth about equal to the thickness of 6 sheets of paper.
(The sensation of touching a Foxfire has been described as being "somewhat like animal down," like "thick cream covering batter or dough," like "touching the bottom of a bowl of porridge," or "like moss on a rock just barely submerged in a brook.")

Unlike many flesh-and-blood races, they are also slightly "elastic": they can be slightly compressed or stretched, without doing them any harm or causing them any pain.
This means that they may sometimes "deform" slightly from their neutral state; when carrying a heavy load, for example, they may slightly "squash", or their arms might be slightly "stretched".
They are cooler to the touch than Humans and Gnolls are, although, like those races, they maintain their own "body-temperature" in different environments.
In their neutral state, they are mostly dark green and dogwood-grey, and they glow with a soft, deep-green light.

They are not restricted to their "neutral" state.
Instead, each one possesses three "natures"; one follows from the forrest that is their Basin, and the other two appear to be inherited.
A great many natures have been observed; even they likely do not know how many there are.
A Foxfire can freely adopt either of its natures or return to its "neutral" state.

The Foxfire's basin is the forest that they inhabit; they have particular influence over the fruit-trees common in those woods, and they have some influence in other forrests and on other fruit-trees.
They are sometimes called "orchard-spirits," because, in centuries passed, the people who lived in the surrounding areas would pay them to bless their orchards.
If separated from their forests, they become increasingly sick and weak; while this effect will not kill them directly, it will eventually render them too weak and delirious to function, in a state much like a deadly fever.

It is their powers over orchards that the Shaded Sea values.
The Foxfire's forest is near the north-center of the Shaded Sea — near the Shade Elves to the west, and the border with Weswtward Province to the north.
The Shade Elves have made slaves of the Foxfire, demanding that the spirits travel throughout the Shaded Sea and bless their master's orchards — on pain of having their forest raized and salted.

Their dependance on their forest makes them particularly difficult to liberate.
Many other of the Shade Elves' "client peoples" can in principle be smuggled to freedom; if the High Road secrets a Minotaur across the border, they are then free in the Commonwealth.
This is not true of the Foxfire; they might be brought to freedom, but they must eventually return to their forest in the Shaded Sea, and to subjugation.
And where they to attempt a rebellion, their forest would be burned to the ground, and their basin destroyed.

### Gremlins

  - These small creatures resemble hairless cats in gross appearance, save that they have hands rather than paws, walk upright, and are not *much* larger.

  - Their homelands where conquered by Goblin kings and warlords long ago, and they have been subjects of the Goblins for centuries.

      - Though the Goblins Code does declare that all other species are inferior to Goblins and are worthy of enslavement, it does grant some species special status over others; Gremlins are one such species.

      - Gremlins are eligible for "favored servant" status; though they are still subordinate to Goblins, Gremlins that have earned this status are afforded preferential treatment and special privilege.

      - Gremlins that have earned this status often serve as faithful retainers, performing tasks that, though they are beneath the dignity of a proper Goblin, still require trust.

      - Gremlins also often serve as soldiers or mercenaries; Gremlins may keep a rabble of lesser slaves in line, or may guard the vulnerable flanks of the Goblin's highly effective long-spear formations.

      - Favored Servant status is often passed down family lines by Gremlins, with parents grooming their offspring to continue in the service of a Goblin King, noble, warlord or family.

      - Favored servants often mark their status with tattoos, which might symbolize their lineage, the Goblin line they serve, or their deeds.

  - Gremlins are more likely than Goblins to flee the Goblin Empire and settle within the Commonwealth.

      - Gremlins that *do not* have "favored servant" status are *especially* likely to attempt to flee.

      - Gremlins that *were* favored servants are likely to receive a cold reception in the Commonwealth, especially among the small communities of Goblins and Gremlins that have settled in free lands, since other Goblin and Gremlin communities in the Commonwealth are likely to view them as traitors, collaborators and thugs.

- Poor Vision: Gremlins have poor vision. Visual perception checks are made at -20.

### Minotaur

Minotaurs are a large, durable race of cattle-like bipeds.
They largely follow a typical bipedal layout, although with many cattle-like features: they are covered in short fur, with patterns like cattle; they have cloven hooves; their heads resemble those of cattle, including horns; and they have small tails.

Minotaurs originate from the southeastern Emerald Plane, in territory that is now controlled by the Shaded Sea Peoples.
They have been in conflict with the shade elves since at least the time of the First Charter, and have been tributaries and subjects of the Shade Elves since CY 491.
As with most tributaries of the Shaded Sea, the Shade Elves do not occupy, fortify or directly control the Minotaurs; instead, they demand a heavy tribute, and force obedience under threat of brutal and devastating reprisal — pay the tribute in its entirity or have your villages and fields razed.

Today, this tribute inclues a heavy levy, requiring that the Mintaurs surrender many of their fittest young adults for service in the Shade Elf military.
This serves a double purpose, allowing the Shaded Sea access to a powerful race, and depriving the Minotaurs themselves of their best fighters; for this later reason, conscripted Minotaurs are almost never allowed to return home.
Many die in combat; those that don't are put to use as laborers elsewhere in the Shaded Sea or sold into slavery elsewhere.

Obviously, this arrangement has done significant damage to Minotaur society.
Centuries ago, they where herders and farmers who showed a flair for masonry and stonework in their early urban construction; today, their masonry is poorly maintained and their villages small, overpopulated and poor — with a particular lack of able-bodied young males.
They suffer from poverty, lack of food, and lack of labor; besides yielding a portion of their own grain harvest, they are forced to herd animals and tend orchards to produce food that they cannot eat for their Shaded Sea masters.
The heavy burden also prevents the Minotaurs from properly manning or maintaining their defences — a situation encouraged by the Shade Elves, the better to keep the Minotaurs under control.

### Mud-Skippers

The Hasidisee were first encountered by commonwealth explorers some time after the discovery of other neighbouring races.
But not on the commonwealth's terms.
Rather, after normalised relationships between the Raptor Protectorate and the Commonwealth had resulted in trust, the first of the secretive, and shy Hasidisee finally allowed themselves to be known.
A network of settlements were identified by their teardrop-shaped, subaquatic dwellings, and further meetings.

The Hasidisee nation is highly fracturous, each tribe largely self-sufficient and able to make their own way.
Though, several times a year, representatives of each tribe will return to the capitol to discuss the status of their communities, and to allow distant tribes to trade and interact.
The tribes themselves identify by the river in which they make their homes, they largely avoid settling in lakes, due to a long-held cultural fear of stangnant or still waters, enough for the most traditional members of the race not to trust even the cleanest of lakes.

Each tribe may decide it's own fate, and as such, while the tribes the commonwealth and protectorate have interactions with are friendly to explorers and visitors (Within reason), there are other tribes that will protect their isolation with force, and even rumors of members of the race seeking acceptance in the goblin empire, or Bone-spiders.
Among Hasidisee, they prefer debate, conversation, and deliberation to handle conflicts between each other, as a result of their limited numbers and physical fragility.

While not a hard rule, Hasidisee tend towards a matriarchal view of the world, and prize leadership qualities in their female young.
They birth young in large clutches of eggs, but the eggs are very vulnerable to conditions of the water around them, and only a handful will hatch, let alone make it to adulthood.
Hasidisee prefer to raise their young in communal creches, as members of the settlement or tribe.
Teaching them all the ancient stories, and how to steward the river.

Hasidisee are highly devout in their offerings and worship of the spirits of the world around them, especially the major spirits governing the rivers they live in.
They are hesitant to actually propitiate spirits, or attempt to bind or bargain with them.
They are also highly reluctant to discuss the reasons for this relationship.

Between their efforts to please the nature spirits, and the vulnerability of their young to the conditions the eggs are laid in, the Hasidisee feel a strong sense of duty to the ecology around themselves.
They dislike the construction of dams, or redirecting of excess water, and have skirmished with the cultures of the ruby Isle for overfishing, or dumping of waste into the waterways they inhabit.
They don't cultivate much in the way of agricultural crops or food, aside from a few lakes given over to subaquatic medicine and plant matter for trade and traditional observances.

As reluctant as the Hasidisee are to open up to outsiders, it's notable that they also make use of the Dwarven cave salamanders, and have for far longer than their exposure to the commonwealth.
Using them as aquatic guard dogs and filial pets, rather than mounts.
They speak of aquifers and vast underground lakes, and it's suggested that their number is higher than appears on the surface.

#### Biology

- Aquadynamic: Hasidisee bodies lack many of the sharper, more
  protruding corners and edges of land-dwellers forms. Combined with
    their webbed extremities, Hasidisee find it easy to redirect and
    maneuver underwater, or move through difficult underwater spaces.
    However, this same smoothness, and a limited amount of pigmentation,
    make them difficult to tell apart from one another without long-term
    exposure.
-   Water-breather: Hasidisee are born underwater, and their gill
    structures allow them to extract oxygen from water easily. They can
    also breathe air, normally, but their mouths are small and
    poorly-developed
-   Aquatic Adaptation: Hasidisee eyes are well-equipped to cut through
    glare and can see easily through water, but are less well-suited to
    vision above the water level. Their hearing, sense of smell, and
    ability to speak similarly suffer.
-   Spear Fishers: Hasidisee are almost born with a fishing spear
    in-hand. Especially underwater, they are capable of propelling
    thrown objects with incredible accuracy.
-   Language of Gestures: Hasidisee language makes extensive use of body
    motions and gestures. Many of these fit well in the constructed
    languages of Protectorate Standard, and Common.

- DUR 25, STR 20
- +5 COG, +5 INT, +5 WIL
- Movement: Swim 5/15, Foot 3/9, Slither 3/9
- Senses: Normal, Life-Sense, Low-Light
- Size: Medium
- Tags: Natural, Amphibious, Aquatic, Cavedweller, Humanoid, Mud-Skipper
- Language Groups: MS, *Mute out of water*
- *Aquatic Adaptation*: Mudskippers are graceful and powerful underwater, but awkward on land.
  - They function as well underwater as terrestrial races do on land: they are able to perform most physical tasks without impairment; they can maneuver powerfully, receiving a +20 bonus to Athletics checks related to swimming; and their senses aren't impaired, as a terrestrial race's would be.
    And, of course, they can breath underwater, thanks to their gills.
  - However, they are somewhat awkward on land: when out of the water, they take a -10 penalty to Perception checks, as their sense are impaired; they take a -10 penalty to checks that include SOM, as they find leverage without buoyancy difficult; and they are functionally mute, as their mouths and vocal cords function poorly in air.
- *Fresh-Water*: Mud-Skippers are fresh-water creatures.
  Salt water will damage their gills and skin, and will slowly poison and suffocate them.
  They take 1 DV for each turn that they are submerged in salt-water.
- *Fragile Gills*: Mud-Skipper gills are a particular weak spot.
  They are large, fragile, vital structures located externally, at the tips of the frills on either side of a Mud-Skipper's head.
  Attacks targetting a Mud-Skipper's gills with a *called shot* do not take the normal -10 penalty for the strike (see *Combat*).
- *Riverside Slither*: Mud-Skippers are adapted to slither on muddy river-banks.
  - When slithering in wet or muddy conditions, the character gains a +10 bonus to Athletics and Stealth checks.
  - They treat hard, sharp or borken surfaces (like cobbling, sand or gravel) as *difficult terrain* when they slither.
- *Psionic Null*: Mud-Skippers exhibit a natural resistance to psionic effects that influence their minds.
  They gain a +10 bonus to checks to resist Sleights that influence or control the minds of others (including those with the *Mental Influence* tag).

#### Optional Trait: Lighted

A rare few Mudskippers are born with mutation that causes their body to glow in darkness.
In many tribes, the hatching of a "Lighted One" is taken as a portentious sign.

- **Effect**: The character glows in the dark, becoming a light source about as bright as a dim oil lantern.
  This light is usually not bright enough to be seen through clothing.
  Obviously, *Lighted* Mudskippers are fairly distinctive, at least when seen in darkness; this imposes a -20 penalty on Stealth checks to *hide* or *blend in to a crowd*.
- *Lighted* Mudskippers are often put under enormous (social) pressure; traits like *Anxious* and *Sensitive* are common.

#### Optional Trait: Cave swimmer

Some Mudskippers display a remarkable aptitude for keeping their barings through complex maneuvers while swimming—even when they can't see.

- **Effect**:
  - The character gains a +10 bonus to checks to navigate.
  - The character reduces penalties to checks to navigate caused by visual impairment by up to 20.

#### Optional Trait: Dam-Builder

Some Mudskippers are particularly adept at working in flowing water.

- **Effect**: the character reduces penalties caused by flowing water by up to 20.

#### Optional Trait: Improved Null

Some Mudskippers are remarkably resistant to outside mental influences.

- **Effect**: The character gains an additional +10 bonus to checks to resist sleights that attempt to influence or control the minds of others (including those with the *Mental Influence* tag).

#### Optional Trait: Mudslide

Mudskippers hunting, foraging or working on the banks of rivers often need a rapid escape or a bit of camouflage.

- **Effect**:
  - The character's *Slither* movement rate improves to 4/12.
  - They gain an addtional +10 bonus to Stealth and Athletics checks while slithering in wet or muddy conditions.

### Raptors

- These small creatures, as much like reptiles as birds, are one of the races originally inhabiting the Ruby Plane.
- They walk upright, are covered in dark-green scales, and feature vibrant feathers as plumage on their heads, arms, and on their short tails.
- Though they are warm-blooded, they don’t handle extremes of temperature very well, and are particularly vulnerable to cold; they are most comfortable in the humid jungles and mountains of the central Ruby Plane.
- They have powerful legs and nasty claws, and are natural climbers and leapers.
- Hundreds of years ago, they were a society of tribal hunters: the young and old lived in settlements, while the healthy ranged and hunted in the thick jungles.
- Contact with the Ratfolk brought them access to worked iron and bronze, and the two collaborated to adapt Ratfolk farming techniques to the deep jungle; these have helped revolutionize Raptor culture.
- Though many of them are still hunters, they have expanded the scale of their agriculture significantly, and trade with Ratfolk burrows for finished weapons and tools.

  - Special: **Grab**
    Your talons are very good at gripping those you attack, digging in through flesh and bone as you do so.
    When attacking with your talons, if you score an exceptional success, you automatically grab your opponent.

### Washers

  - The name “washers” was taken from observations of the species by early Commonwealth explorers; “Jerks” is a fair (if polite) translation of the name they have for themselves.
  - Washers are small, furry, and semi-humanoid in gross layout.
      - They are covered in dull, grey-brown fur, with a distinctive black “eye-mask” pattern on their faces and black rings around their bushy tails.
      - Washers move more naturally on all fours than they do upright; their arms and legs are unusually short and oddly-proportioned by humanoid standards.
      - Washers have extremely dexterous hands and feet, and they are very strong climbers.
      - Washers have an extraordinary sense of touch in their hands—so keen that they can better perceive a small object by feeling it than by looking at it.  Members of other races may find it cute when Washers frenetically paw small objects to examine them—and more than a little unnerving when they manipulate fine objects without looking at them.
  - Washers lived in a region in the east of the Raptor’s Plane, in the forests that bordered on the sandy, arid northeastern peninsula.
      - Tragically, that sandy, arid northeastern peninsula was the region first conquered by the Goblinoid Kings (and now ruled by the Goblin Empire).
      - Not long after discovering them, the Goblins attempted to make slaves of the Washers, highly valuing their tiny, dexterous hands; they quickly decided that the Washers’ temperament made them unsuitable for enslavement, and moved instead to eradicate them.
      - Too late did the Washers ally themselves with the Raptors and join their alliance with the Ratfolk; by this time, they only had one major city left, and a total surviving population of just more than a quarter-million.
      - Today, the Washer’s territory defines the border between the Raptor’s Alliance and the Goblinoid territories.
  - Washers have an impish sense of humor.

They receive a +20 bonus to tests involving the precise manipulation of small objects, including Disable Device tests, some Sleight of Hand tests, and tests using many Art and Craft skills.

## Exotic Races

### Bone Spiders

Bone Spiders are among the more unique races to set foot on the Emerald Plane.

Bone Spiders are arranged somewhat like crabs or spiders, but much larger; they have a large central section about a meter across, from which six meter-long legs extend.
They have a head section at one end; it is not articulated with a neck, but continuous with the body.
Two arms extend from the front, from slightly below the head, one on either side of it.
They have multiple eyes—two large ones on the head facing forward, and four smaller pairs situated around the head; this arrangement gives them more than 180 degrees of vision, and allows them to see above and below them.
Bone Spiders have large bone plates covering their backs, underbellies and limbs.
There are a half-dozen diamond-shaped plates on their back, which overlap at their edges a little like scale mail; the plates on their underbellies are segmented, arranged in strips.
Bone Spiders are semi-aquatic; they have gills on their underbellies, and can breathe underwater, though they are not particularly good swimmers.
Bone Spiders are omnivorous.

Bone Spiders only recently made contact with the Commonwealth.
Bone Spider explorers first discovered the Emerald Plane and the Commonwealth some twenty years ago; a trickle of Bone Spider merchants have followed.

Bone Spiders are from a lone island some two months’ voyage from the eastern coast of the Emerald Plane.
Their island is not large: it is roughly circular, and it would take less than two weeks to cross it on food at its widest.
The island is rocky and mountainous, rising to a single low peak in its middle.
Along its northern and southern coasts, the rocks descend directly into the sea; besides a few lagoons, there is little arable land.
Along the eastern and western coasts, there are flat stretches, hosting thin bands of soil and greenery between the sandy shores and the rocky slope.

The Bone Spiders earliest culture began in a system of flooded caves and caverns in the center of their island.
Among their earliest myths are the stories of ascending from the deep caves to surface, and then descending form the slopes of the mountain to discover the thin crescents of fertile ground on their eastern and western coasts.
Bone Spiders have long practiced aquaculture in the shallows around their island, and have a long history of boat-building and sailing.
Only within the last hundred years did Bone Spiders begin to develop the kinds of boats that could cross the open ocean.

The total Bone Spider population is not large; they have largely filled in the habitable portions of their island and the shallows around it, though they number fewer than five hundred thousand.
Despite this fact, they seem in little hurry to expand onto the Emerald Plane.
They do seem eager to trade, however, and a steady trickle of Bone-Spider merchant-ships have docked at ports along the eastern and southern coasts of the Emerald Plane.

Those traders who do encounter these rare creatures should be advised: Bone Spiders find attempts to mimic their culture to be *very* tiresome.

Bone Spiders produce several varieties of beer, wine and liquor from the plants they grow in aquaculture; these exotic spirits fetch a high price in the Commonwealth's market.
Merchants who deal with them know that Bone Spiders will not actually drink the spirits that they sell; nor do they mistake the wax-paper containers the wine is stored in as a sign of quality.
