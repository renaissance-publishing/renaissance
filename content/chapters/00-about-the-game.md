title: "About the Game"

This is an early alpha of an open-source fantasy RPG.

We're working on it.
We've got a lot of the mechanics in a fairly good place, at least for what we want to do, and most of the "core" player options are present.
Now we just need to take all the long bullet-lists and convert them to full English text.
And also write in all the background stuff that's in my (the lead author's) head but that has never been written down anywhere.

And make sure all the revisions and rule-versions are consistent.

And also add more player content and options.

We're working on it.

## Changes since last time:

- Added shields, woops;
  - I accidentally dropped them when I merged in CV's big combat-items pass.

- Adding more asides in Items and Wealth.
- rewriting and expanding a bunch of race blocks.
  - Gnolls have a lot more text, and arctic gnolls are mentioned now.
  - Greatly expanding Dwarves (they were stubbed), adding CV's Mycenaean Dwarves idea.

- Added a few of CV's powers.
  - and then a bunch more, and some classes.
- Started reworking the wealth section.
- Started adding examples to the skills section.
- *Finished* reworking the wealth section!  Added Cash, added trade goods, removed barter.
- tweaking guns a lot.
  - they didn't get adjusted with the big weapons rebalance.
  - Instead of reducing their damage, we upped their reload; we've been making other tweaks.

- Added a section for the Haffa in the Kingdoms write-up.
- Some clean-up in Common Hazards.
- Major editing and clean-up in the Wealth section.
- Broke *Backgrounds, Traits, Classes and Powers* into four separate chapters.
  - Mainly because it was getting two absurdly long.
  - *More reorganization work is still required here.*
- Move Member from a Trait to a Class.
- Added a Chapter for The Mundain: Travelling
  - It's called that because it's right before *Cheating Reality: Magic*.
  - I need to put things in it.  And possibly also move and retitle it.
- Major edits on *this very about page*;
  - some of the content here dated back to *before Sinestro did the website*.
- Moved things around to add a *travelling* chapter and a *Secrets* chapter,
  - and just barely started filling things in.
- Tweaked the "from the authors" page,
  - which is now the intro page.  (We should rename the file.)
- Added a bunch of content to the *travelling* section.
  - It's still got a bunch of stubs.
- Added a *soothe* skill, useful for healing stress.
  - I don't like this one but it's a start.
- Removed a bunch of the skills that we already crossed out.
- Lots of editing in the healing section.
  - Lots of rewording.
  - Added some clarifications.
  - Added rules for *Soothe* (again, not great, but it's a start).
  - Added the option for *surgery* which can be used after you botch a test to bind a wound.
  - Slightly changed how *Stress* works.  (Now there are two tags!)
- Total rewrite of the Building Characters chapter, to reflect the "five roles" concept
  - and not repeat that information.
  - And to have concrete build guidance and fluff bits.
  - This is going to be an undertaking.
- There where two Unarmed Combat sections; I merged them, and cleaned up some wording.
  - I also pulled a crossed-out section out, and moved a design-note aside.
- Extensive bullet-list-to-text conversion in *Basic Rules*.
  - complete with editing, sections, examples and asides.
  - And some text to help describe what the *Common Checks* are supposed to be, with a few cross-references.
- Some light editing in the *Combat* section.
- Added a blank chapter where we're going to talk about what adventures look like.
- Changed Ground-Explorer to Deep-Explorer.
- Filled in the *Adventures* chapter a little bit.
- More clean-up in the Combat section
  - turned some bullet-lists into text.
  - Moved the damage half of *charging* into the movement section.
  - Bracing is still its own section.
- Added some variant armors, dicking around in the armor section.
- Added rations.
- Added some sample special arrows.
- Moved the "crafting recipe" system into an alternate rule,
  - changed that aside to make it clear that, yes, if you have a crafter character, then RAW you just get to have as much scour as you want.
- Continuing reorganization in Combat
  - Added a "Special Actions" sections and put a bunch of stuff there.
  - "Strikes" is still a long bullet-list, but that's good enough for now.
  - Added basic statements for drawing and sheathing weapons, aiming.
  - Moved *Focusing on Defence* to this part.
- Changed the proficiencies for Athletics.
- Initial work merging in CV's "How to Play Healers" section.
- Tweaking and updating to the Senses section of the racial abilities chapter.

## To-Do

- revise items-and-down for new attack skills.
- Edit the example section to match the last like 3 revisions of changes, god.
- Update the Ratfolk entry to flow a little more like the Elven one.
- Lots more player options\!
  - I did the classes and powers and backgrounds that where
    interesting to me, but I really need to do samples for others
    too.
  - More Items\! Especially more magical items\!
- Change *Maneuvers* to maybe *Feats* as the name for martial powers.
- Convert “walk” and “run” movement to “base” and “full”, respectively.
- We need massive editing. I’ve been resisting, but it’s large enough that we can’t use it without some major clean-up.
- Rework the intro sections.
- Update the “bestiary” part, since it’s more-than-two rules revisions out of date.
  - Also, tag the things in it with a difficulty hint.
  - And add Sinestro’s Cold Shadows and Sauce’s Whisps.
- Fill in the *Raptor's Protectorate* and the *Shaded-Sea People*, dear god.
- Add examples for all the skills.
- Add optional rules for ranking profession skills by wealth?
- Copy over a bunch of the finalized names, dates and units.
- fill in the stubs in *travelling* and *common hazards*.
- Fill in the *Secrets* section.
- Finish updating the *From-the-Authors* section,
  - including renaming the file.
- Right now, the *Basic Rules* chapter is... fucked up and mostly asides.
  - And right now the definition of "basic proficiency" appears to be in a side-bar, which isn't ideal.
- Write the rules for *recovering raw materials*; I'm thinking scrounging, "gathering professions", and breaking things down.
  - And fix the time-table for producing recipes; it's out of whack right now.

## Editing Notes

- I need to go through and use the term Tag consistently. And then also re-work most entries to use Tags.
- Likewise, use “Check” consistently, as opposed to “Test”.
- I’m trying to use “the character” or “a character” consistently, to emphasize that players and NPCs use the same rules. I need to go back and edit this to be the case.
  - Sometimes this results in tortured language, I might need to reevaluate.
- I’m trying to use “they” in cases where gender is unknown or unspecified. I *really hate* the “pick an arbitrary gender” writing style that many d20 systems use.
- I’d like to use lower-case for race names (“orc” and “elf” instead of “Orc” and “Elf.” I was using caps for a long while tho, so much editing will be required.)
  - I give up, I'm going back to caps-ing race names.
- It’s spelled “orc” by the way.
- At least for now, I’ve decided on just calling it *magic*. I wanted to use something a little fancier, like *essence*, but I couldn’t come up with something I wanted to commit to. I’m using the terms *mage* and *spell,* *psion* and *sleight*, and *priest* and *boon*. I may revisit this.
  - I’ve specifically avoided using “arcane” as a description, because it annoys me that a generation of grognards are growing up who think that that word means “knowledge magic” and don’t realize that it actually just means “difficult secret.”
- Note: I need to use Emerald Plane, Ruby Plane and Worldspine consistently.
- We use colored highlighting\! We put sidebars and clarifications in teal, FIXME notes in yellow, examples in purple, playtester questions in salmon, and GM Guidance in green.    
  - There may not be enough difference between GM Guidance and most Sidebars to give them different colors.
  - Also, the two GM Guidance blocks so far are *really long*, so treating them like a sidebar might not work.
- ... does anyone know of a gender-neutral replacement for words like "craftsman" and "Swordsman" that won't also result in tortured language?
- I think I'm going to start using a "bold-at-definition, italics-at-reference" style for keywords.
  - I'll need to go back and reformat... a christing lot.
- For now, we're using the term *Movement Mode*.  We might change it to *Movement* later.
