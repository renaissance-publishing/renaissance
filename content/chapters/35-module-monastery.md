title: "Sample Module: A Crisis in Northland"
---

## Introduction

This is a small sample module.
It is based on the very first game that was used to test *Rensaissance*, and it's a good example of *horror* game, in the "tales-of-the-weird" sense.

## Player Prompt

A ferocious blizzard has descended on the *Hella Valley*; almost a white-out, it has trapped the people of the valley in their homes and brought life to a standstill.

For whatever reason, you are in *Southlander's Market*, a small city inhabited mostly by Humans and Ratfolk in the south of valley.
As the name implies, *Southlander's Market* is something of a trade-hub for the valley; it sits on Hella High-Road, a nominal highway that runs out of the valley to the east, leading to the Tol Confederacy more than fifteen *demarc* away, and eventually to the rest of the Commonwealth.

The city shares the valley with the *Weavers' Hold*, a Dwarven hold known for their wools; *Forge-and-Hearth Burrow*, a Kobold burrow that hosts the valley's most skilled smiths; the centuries-old *Whitefox Monastery*; and a number of smaller Human and Gnollish hamlets.

The situation in *Southlander's Market* is slowly deteriorating.
No contact has been had with Weaver's Hold, Forge-and-Hearth Burrow or — most alarmingly — Whitefox Monastery for days — much less anyone travelling up the highway from the wider Commonwealth.
While the village is well-enough stocked for the week ahead at least, if the blizzard does not break, the city may begin to succumb to hunger and cold.

Many in the town believe that someone should make the trek to the monastery to see if there's anything that they can do.
Landlord Ceder-Inn, the Ratfolk who runs the Ceder Inn in *Southlander's Market*, has decided to take matters into his own hands, and is trying to arrange a party to make the trip.

## Overview

## Starting Out

The adventure starts out in the Ceder Inn in *Southlander's Market*.
Like many *intrigue* and *horror* games, the first part of the module will consist of *preparation* and *investigation* — that is, after character introductions have been made, and the player-characters have accepted the *quest*.

They likely won't spend *much* time in *Southlander's Market*.
There aren't any particular clues here; no-one in town knows what's happening and why (other than the *Traitor*), so asking about, though a wise precaution, won't be particularly fruitful.

The major risk is that they'll find the *Traitor Monk* (see below) — that is, if you're using the *Traitor Monk* and you've put them in the town.
Obviously, you'll want to keep the party from discovering the traitor if encountering them early can end the adventure; successes on investigation might yield hints about *suspicious travelers*, but you should avoid clues that might lead the party directly to the traitor.

### Location: Hella Valley

Hella Valley is named after the *Hella*, the name given to the Humans and Dwarves that live in the region, and their (partly) shared culture.

<<<<<<< HEAD
The valley funs from east to west; the Worldspine Mountains rise to the west, and, even though the peaks of the range are far to the south, the smaller mountains and rough foothills to the west are still a formidable natural barrier — especially given the cold.

>>>>>>> 4ace75267ab240f5151499b06d0111b9b6d8cf24

The valley is well forrested, and the Hella River runs through it.
The valley is dotted with small farming towns, and it also sees logging, trapping and fishing.
The river usually swells during the spring thaw, but all the cities and towns are built far enough from it to be out of danger.

### Location: Southlander's Market

*Southlander's Market* is a small town of little more than one-and-a-half thousand people, mostly Humans and Ratfolk.
The town is built around the *Hella High-Road*, which runs to *Weaver's Hold* higher in the Worldspine Mountains to the southwest, and out of the valley to the east.
As the name implies, it's the region's major market; what travellers that come usually do so by taking the road into the valley, and folk from the 'Hold, the 'Burrow, and the various hamlets in the region come to the market in *Southerlander's Market* to sell their wares.

The town combines Dwarven, Human and Ratolk influences in its design.
It is roughly rectangular in design, running from east to west with the road; it's 9 blocks *east to west*, and only five blocks *north to south*.
It's surrounded by a wall, but that wall hasn't been well-maintained; it's been a long time since raiders came here.

Most of the buildings are constructed of timber — corner-joined, with the logs cut square, some faced with planks or plaster, some not.
<<<<<<< HEAD
A few of the nicer buildings are made of brick.
Most have thick, thatched rooves, to keep out the cold and winter snow.

The valley isn't far enough north that the ground is permafrost — it thaws in the spring.
A number of the buildings incorporate dug-out portions and basements.

>>>>>>> 4ace75267ab240f5151499b06d0111b9b6d8cf24

The city isn't wealthy; many of the people there are farmers and trappers.

The *Southlander's Temple* and the *Council House* sit at the center of the town, facing each-other across the street.
The town's *market square* runs two blocks in either direction around the center, opening up around the road.

<<<<<<< HEAD
### Location: The Market
=======
Forge-and-Hearth Burrow is a small Kobold burrow that sits three *demarc* northeast of Southlander's Market.
The population is less than 500.
It consists of a large, central burrow, surrounded by a number of smaller single-family burrows and surface structures — some of the surface structures are older than the burrow itself, built by the first Kobold settlers more than 200 years ago before they had dug the burrow.
>>>>>>> 4ace75267ab240f5151499b06d0111b9b6d8cf24

The eponymous market of *Southlander's Market* sits at the center of the town, surrounding the *Temple* and *Council House* and opening up along the road to either side.
The surrounding buildings have shops and store-fronts that open up onto the market.
In better weather, these shops open up, and they are also joined in the market by at least a few travelling merchants; in the bitter cold and snow of winter, many of the shops close, and visiting merchants are few.

Realistically, the major thing that the party can do here is *stock up* for the adventure ahead.
Rations are easy enough to acquire; even half-closed, they can likely find someone to sell them cereals, smoked-meats and other foods fit for travel.
They can also find stores that will sell them the equipment appropriate to the trip ahead — tents, nap-sacks, warm clothing, rope, and so on; this is best handled by having characters purchase a *Survival* skill-kit, or optionally adapt an existing skill-kit for extreme cold.
Magical items are few, but characters can likely find useful devices for the region — *Lights*, *Heaters*, *Torques of Speaking* and *Warmblood Suits* are all available, although not in great supply.

The party will find weapons and armor difficult to come buy — especially weapons that require large amounts of high-quality material or workmanship.
Axes and quilted armors are available, but plate armor and broadswords are right-out.

### Location: The Ceder Inn

The Ceder Inn is located thirty paces outside the city wall, situated on the road into town.
It consists of several buildings, all of timber constructions and painted bright red.
The largest buildings are the main building and the barn; there is also a separate house for the Ceder-Inn family, a stables, a shed and a pair of saunas.
The stables and inn are next to the road, with the saunas, shed, family-house and barn being behind them.
*Covered paths* connects all of the buildings; the paths are dug half a *stride* into the ground, and have log walls and a thatch roof.

The *saunas* are small, circular buildings with brick walls.

The main inn consists of a large, central common-room, with a large stone hearth in the center.
Some people sleep in the common-room, but there are also private rooms along one wall.
(Some guests even choose to sleep in the lofts above the barn and stables.)
The kitchen is an open structure accessed through the back; three walls are timber, but one wall is open, to allow the kitchen to ventilate in the summer.
In winter, the kitchen's fourth wall is blocked with a large, heavy wool cover.

The Ceder Inn is where the "quest-giver", Landlord Ceder-Inn, lives, so it's where the adventure is likely to start.
Any PCs that aren't from the area may also be staying at the Ceder Inn.
The inn mostly sells food; if the PCs need anything more than rations — or if they need a *lot* of rations — they'll need to travel to the *market* to equip.

### Location: Forge-and-Hearth Burrow

Forge-and-Hearth Burrow is a small Kobold burrow that sits three *demarc* northeast of Southlander's Market.
The population is less than 500.
It consists of a large, central burrow, surrounded by a number of smaller single-family burrows and surface structures—some of the surface structures are older than the burrow itself, built by the first Kobold settlers more than 200 years ago before they had dug the burrow.

Forge-and-Hearth is well-named; it's occupants are miners, fishers and trappers, and the burrow is known for its iron, fish and food.

There isn't much for the party to do at Forge-and-Hearth.
The burrow has good miners, but only a few smiths; they mostly sell iron to human smiths in Southlander's Market.
(Ambition has designs on apprenticing the young of the burrow to the human smiths of nearby Southlander's Market and eventually turning Forge-and-Hearth into a regional center of steel-work, but her plans have not yet come to fruition.)
They will also sell the party skins, jerkies, food or lodging, of course.
If the party needs iron or jerky, they can get it here, but that's about it.

### Character: Landlord Ceder-Inn

Landlord Ceder-Inn — as one could infer from his name — is the owner of the Ceder Inn.
Outgoing, lively, sociable, and intelligent, Ceder-Inn is a natural businessperson well suited to running the inn.
His inn has flourished under his management, and he's become a wealthy, prominent local citizen.
He is middle-aged, with jet-black fur, and slightly portly, though not obese.
He also leads a large household; besides himself, there is his wife, his cousin, and four children — the youngest of which was married in last spring, and may soon make him a grandfather.

Landlord Ceder-Inn is effectively the *quest-giver* for the adventure; Ceder-Inn has recruited several of the town's prominent citizens and businesspeople — including South-Vintner — to offer a reward to any party that can venture out through the blizzard to Witefox Monastery, in the hopes that they can ply the local spirits and find some way to help with the blizzard.

### Minor Character: Rust-Fur

Rust-Fur is the Gnollish commander of the local Commonwealth guard; he's a male Gnoll in his early thirties, and he lives and operates out of Southlander's Market.
He's respected by the locals as a leader and probably-solver.
While he doesn't know anything about the magical blizzard, his knowledge of the area might be useful — although it will be difficult for the party to convince him to abandon his post to travel to the monastery.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Rust-Furr might be useful if the party doesn't have anyone with good ranks in Survival; he can lead them to the monastery — or assign a Guard to the task, if matters elsewhere keep him busy, or he decides he doesn't like the party.

>>>>>>> 4ace75267ab240f5151499b06d0111b9b6d8cf24

Rust-Furr would also make a decent PC, if there's a player in the group struggling to come up with a good character-concept.

### Minor Character: "Prince" South-Vintner

Named South-Vintner in Common but dubbed "the prince" by the city-folk, South-Vintner is the mayor of Southlander's Market.
The young scion of a wealthy family further south, it's widely (and correctly) held that it's more wealth than competence that got him his office.
Even so, he isn't a bad person; he's honest, hard-working and insightful — even if isn't perhaps a natural leader.
He's working hard to prove himself.

South-Vintner can provide the party with resources and support.
If the party needs resources they can't afford, they might be able to convince South-Vintner to bankroll them.
South-Vintner can also secure the cooperation of professionals in the town, from blacksmiths to doctors.

He lives in a well-appointed house near the center of town, about a block behind the Council House; he can typically be found either there, or at the Council House itself.

### Minor Character: Ambition

One Kobold matriarch, named *Ambition* in Common, wants to start producing high-quality steel in Forge-and-Hearth.
She's been trying to form a closer partnership with the human smiths of *Southlander's Market*—including apprenticing some of her more talented children in the 'Market.

### Encounter: Negotiating

One of the first "Encounters" in the module is receiving the quest from Landlord Ceder-Inn.
Ceder-Inn will briefly describe the problem, and explain the offer — a number of local prominent citizens have put up a purse for anyone who can venture out to the Whitefox Monastery, in the hope that the current savage blizzard has a supernatural cause that the monks can put right.
The journey will be difficult, even for those used to roughing it in the woods in the winter; the party will be well-advised to prepare appropriately.

The purse on offer is not extravagant — Southlander's Market is not a wealthy town.
It consists of 95 gold pieces; valuable spices, skins, and metals equivalent to three Level 3 *trade goods*; the services of local artisans.
If you'd like to set more adventures in the Hella Valley, you can include property in the valley, like fields or houses.

The purse is to be given to the party on their return, although it may be possible to haggle Ceder-Inn into granting the party an advance — especially if they can't undertake the trip without it.

### Encounter: Equipping the Party

If the party needs equipment, they can head to the market.
As described above, the market is mostly closed — there isn't much business to do in the blizzard.
However, some of the town's merchants and artisans may be willing to do business with the party, once they explain what the goods will be in service of.

The town bosts several blacksmiths, two alchemists, and a mage; while they can be convinced to produce for the party something that they need, this will take time — time that will count against the week that the city has before it starts to get into trouble.

## The Trip

The trek through the blizzard to Whitefox Monastery is the real starting-point for the adventure: now the players have left the relative safety of Southlander's Market, and have gone to face the unknown.

### Location: The Valley

### Encounter: The Blizzard

[[designnote]]
| Remember that a *demarc* (*dc*) is about 2.6 miles or about 4.2 kilometers, and a *stride* (*sd*) is about 30 inches or 75 cm.

Whitefox Monastery is only about 4dc away from Southlander's Market; where it not for the blizzard, it would not be a particularly difficult journey, even in winter.
The blizzard, however, does complicate things.

The thick snow and near-whiteout conditions will dramatically slow the party's pace; the *base pace* in the blizzard will be only 2dc-per-day (see *Travel*).
Additionally, navigation will be particularly difficult; the party will need to make a *Survival* check to navigate, and that check will have a -30 penalty.
(Some example check results are given below.)
Foraging for food (see *Travel*) will be exceptionally difficult, and will also suffer a -30 penalty.

| Navigation Check | Result |
| ---------------- | ------ |
| Basic Success | Normal Progress |
| Exceptional Success | Sheltered Camp Site, Good Progress (improve progress by 1dc), Sheltered Route (+20 to Feat of Endurance check against cold) |
| Critical Success | Excellent Progress (improve progress by 2dc), *Whitefox Bridge* |
| Basic Failure | Lose Progress (reduce progress by 1dc) |
| Exceptional Failure | Exposed Route (-20 to Feat of Endurance checks), Natural Hazard (hidden pit, fall down slope) |
| Critical Failure | Party Becomes Lost (getting barrings is a one-hour Task Action requiring a Survival check at -20), Party Becomes Separated (searching is a one-hour Task Action requiring a Search check at -10; lost characters may panic; characters without Survival are at risk of freezing) |

Making camp will also be difficult; unlike normal, the party will need to make a *Survival* check to assemble a camp that will allow them to survive the extreme cold.
(Characters can mitigate this by finding a cave or other natural feature to shelter in, but this will require a *Search* or *Survival* check at -20.
Characters might also be rewarded with such a *sheltered camp-site* if they score an exceptional success while navigating, as described above.)

The cold will be a significant hazard; each member of the party will need to make a *Feat of Endurance* test at the end of every day they spend in the snow.
(If they choose to keep traveling at night instead of making camp, have them make a second *Feat of Endurance* check for the night.)
Each time a character fails a *Feat of Endurance* check, they suffer 1d10DV, with the *Cold* and *Environmental* tags; resistances, vulnerabilities and other similar features apply, but armor does not.

Note that the extreme cold is particularly deadly to cold-blooded characters; they'll need to bring along some source of warmth (like a Warmblood Suit, a Heater, or the Fireball power) or they'll almost certainly freeze to death.
<<<<<<< HEAD
Ordinarily, no test would be allowed for a cold-blooded creature; most will fall into a torpor within an hour of exposure, and will be dead within hours.
=======
(Ordinarily, no test would be allowed for a cold-blooded creature; most will fall into a torpor within an hour of exposure, and will be dead within hours.)
>>>>>>> 4ace75267ab240f5151499b06d0111b9b6d8cf24
Cold-blooded creatures with no other source of warmth can attempt to share body-heat with a warm-blooded creature — although doing this while actively travelling can be *difficult*, unless the cold-blooded character is particularly portable.
Sharing warmth in this way imposes a -10 penalty on the warm-blooded character, but it allows the cold-blooded character to make a Feat of Endurance check against the cold at -20.

(If one of your players is playing a cold-blooded character, you can make both your life and theirs simpler if you suggest they purchase a Warmblood Suit in the market.
Note also that creatures with the *Dragon-Kin* (like Drakes and Kobolds) and *Saurians* (like Raptors) are *not* cold-blooded.)

[[designnote]]
| The blizzard is a "soft barrier": it traps the party in the monastery and separates them from the city and help, so they have to face the Monster alone; but it's not impenetrable.
| In some circumstances, the party *may* decide to try to trek back through the blizzard to reach the town; this might happen if they are badly injured, or determine that they don't have the skills and resources to solve the mystery.
| (Notably, most of these are at least potentially failure states.)

[[designnote]]
| We've spent a fair amount of text describing how dangerous the blizzard is, because its intended to be a major hazard for the adventure.
| Bute a character who takes most of the teleportation-related powers can easily bypass it — at least on the way back from the monastery, if not on the way to it (because they don't know where they're going and are at risk for teleporting into a wall, tree, mountain, etc.).
|
| This is actually perfectly acceptable; a character who takes most of the teleportation powers has invested a significant ammount of points!
| To be really proficient, they will have had to buy several powers, and good ranks in both Spellcraft and Athletics (you need good Athletics to be good at teleporting, because teleporting counts as a movement mode; see the note on the power).
| At that point, they've earned the right to use teleporting to solve a problem.
| (If it helps, think of teleporting as another reasonable strategy for winning the "encounter" with the blizzard.)

### Location: Hella River

The Hella River runs northeast, flowing from higher up in the peaks of the Worldspine Mountain to Hellas Lake 5dc outside the valley.
The Hella River is not a wide or swift river; for most of its length, it's about 25 *strides* across, and only 6sd deep.
(During the spring thaw, it swells and flows more rapidly; that is not likely to be a concern for the party during this adventure.)

Right now, of course, the river is frozen over, and represents a potential challenge.

### Point-of-Interest: Whitefox Bridge

Whitefox Bridge is an arching stone bridge more than three hundred years old.
The residents of Hella Valley have kept the bridge in good repair, important as it is for reaching Whitefox Monastery.

The major benefit it provides for this adventure is the ability to resolve the *River Crossing* encounter.

### Encounter: River Crossing

## The Monastery

The monastery is where the bulk of the adventure takes place.
It's where all the clues to the mystery reside — as well as the monster!

### Location: The Monastery

Whitefox Monastery is more than four-and-a-half centuries years old.
Humans from the Empire first settled in the region more than a thousand years ago; the region was incorporated into the Commonwealth more than six hundred years ago.
A manorial charter was granted to the Whitefox Monks in CY 298, more than five hundred years ago; the current Whitefox Monastery was built between CY 361 and CY 365, when the manor (which included what would become Southlander's Market) grew wealthy enough.
(As a reminder, this adventure is set in the winter of CY 831.)

The building is roughly square; it's build around an open *ritual space* on the inside, surrounded by various living and working spaces.
It's two stories high; the first *stride* of the ground floor is construct of faced masonry, but the rest of the height of the building is constructed of large bricks.
There are a few narrow windows on each floor.
The corners are cylindrical, enclosing spiral staircases.
There's a large *gate* on the southern face, which leads directly into a small *front room* and then the ritual space.

As the party approaches the monastery, hope for an resolution should fade: the gate is open, and no light can be seen from the narrow windows.
Characters with *Infra-Red Vision* can verify that the building is cold; characters with *Scent* may detect the smell of death.

Notably, characters who walk around behind the monastery may notice a much larger window behind the ritual space.
This window is intact, but characters who *really* want to avoid going through the front door (for whatever reason) could break it to gain access.

### Point-of-Interest: Outside

Characters who search outside the monastery — or score exceptional successes on Perception checks while approaching — may notice *bodies* frozen in the snow.

### Point-of-Interest: The Ritual Space

The ritual space dominates the interior of the monastery.
It's a great, open, granite-floored room.
Shrines to the various Great Spirits of the region line the walls, as well as small cabinets for ritual items.

The *Altar* sits at the north end of the room on a raised platform.

### Point-of-Interest: The Altar

The *Altar* sits at the north end of the ritual space on a raised wooden platform.
The platform runs from (side-)wall to (side-)wall, underneath a great, open glass window.

The remains of a *ritual* remain on the altar.

## Customizing the Module

Some parts of the module are fixed — like the town, the monastery, the blizzard and the monster.
A traitor-priest (for one reason or another) negotiated between several spirits (including Bones-of-Deep-Rock) to release one of the spirits of the dead, and grant it great powers; this is the source of both the monster and the blizzard.

Other parts, however, are designed to be variable: what was the plot, and how will the party defeat the monster and end the blizzard?

In order to run the adventure, you'll need to pick one of the following "plots," and use it to finish out the module — or combine several of them, or come up with one of your own!

### "Alien"

In some ways, this is a very simple scenario: it's a fight for survival in an isolated, eery location against an implacable, ferocious foe.
There's no particular secret to unlock or mystery to solve: the monster is at the center of it, and you have to kill it before it kills you.

In this story, the *Traitor* still created the monster, for whatever reason — but that's of little consequence now.
The monster is *unbound*; even if the party identify the traitor and fully understand the ritual he used, there's nothing that knowledge will allow them to do.
All they can do is defeat it.

In this scenario, designing and running the monster is particularly critical.
It needs to be tough enough that defeating it can take up a good chunk of the adventure.
It should be tough enough that it can strike, inflict some painful damage, and then survive to fade away.
On the other hand, it also needs to be possible to defeat it; it probably *shouldn't* be able to simple hop into a new corpse when it dies, because that will potentially put the party in a place where they need to defeat it *70 times*—which shouldn't be practical.
Essentially, this means that you should probably improve its DUR, STR and Armor — and possibly give it a regeneration mechanism — but that you *shouldn't* allow it to hop bodies.

It's also important to wisely deploy the monster.
Don't over-use it; it shouldn't be running about howling and attacking all the time, but instead should lunge out of the darkness to strike only at tense or vulnerable moments.
Remember that it's the spirit of a dead mortal; that means that it has human(oid) intelligence.
It's ferocious, but it's also *far* more intelligent than a lion or bear: it will avoid obvious traps, sneak around, attempt to trip or disarm opponents, and maybe even set traps of its own.
It even has the capability of language — although it has about as much to say to the party as a lion does to a gazelle.
However, if it can spy on the party, it might be able to understand what they're saying, which will give it a decided edge (if it shares a language with them — which depends on exactly whose spirit it is, which is a detail up to you as the GM).

Finally, it's a good idea to reveal to the players *fairly* quickly what they need to do; don't force them to assemble a lot of clues if the ultimate solution is going to be "kill it!"

#### "Alien" Details

- Make the monster *tough*
  - +10 DUR
  - +5 STR
  - +2 Armor
  - *can eat corpses to heal*
- Make the monster *defeatable*
  - it can't *jump bodies*
- Limited, direct *clues*
  - don't bother with the **traitor's alcove**.
  - analysis of the **notes at the trator's desk** will reveal that defeating the monster will end the blizzard.
  - the **ritual remains** on the **altar** don't reveal much.

### Negotiation

This scenario proceeds much like the previous one, with one difference: we assume that a lion might have a meaningful discussion with gazelles if it's *outnumbered* and *outgunned*.

Essentially, in this scenario, we assume two things: that monster doesn't want to be defeated — perhaps destroying it will send it back into the realms of the dead, and it doesn't want that to happen — and that it can leave the monastery (and that the blizzard will follow it).
(We also note that the analogy to lions and gazelles is imperfect, since the monster doesn't actually *need* to kill people; it's only doing that because it's already dead and beyond mortal concern, which means it has no particular reason to care about morality.)
This opens up a kind of opportunity for the party: they can perhaps negotiate with it.

There's a simple and compelling utilitarian case to make here: "if you keep trying to kill us, we'll have to kill you, and that's bad for you.
Instead, if you simply left — and, hopefully, take the blizzard with you — we'll stop needing to kill you."

While this saves the Hella Valley, it also creates a problem somewhere else.
If the monster travels to the lonely peaks of the World-Spine (for example), then that's fine — it won't be bothering anyone up there.
If, however, it simply descends on a neighboring town, then the party will be responsible for a major disaster.
And, of course, this leaves the wanton slaughter of the monks unavenged.
This creates excellent opportunity for moral haggling within the party!

Of course, it probably won't be obvious to the players that they can talk to the monster; if you don't give them a hint, they might mistake it for a run-of-the-mill "game zombie."
You might consider having the monster deliver a *line* at some point, to paint a message in blood, to build effigies, or to otherwise take steps that indicate that it's intelligent (and is aware that the party is intelligent).
Note that trying to trick or terrorize the party might be early signs that the monster is intelligent and has a theory-of-mind.

Don't be *too* heavy-handed, though; you can require COG×3 checks, protocol checks, or other appropriate checks for the characters to realize that the monster is intelligent.

#### "Negotiation" Details

- Much as the *"Aliens"* scenario.
- Possibly add a hint in the **notes at the traitor's desk** that the monster could be reasoned with.
- Demonstrate intelligent behavior form the monster.

### Unsummoning

In this scenario, the particular ritual that the *traitor* used is *reversible*.
The party can perform a ritual of their own, which will destroy the monster and end the blizzard.

There are several benefits to this scenario:

- one is that it puts the *Analysis* characters right at the center of the adventure;
- another is that it sets up an excellent climactic encounter: the monster is intelligent, and will likely try to disrupt their ritual (even if it doesn't know for sure what they're doing, it can probably guess that another ritual, reusing the same elements, is probably bad for it)

This also gives you a chance to use the **ritual remains** to great effect — which is good if you like creepy, dramatic set-pieces.

Another benefit is that you can use the monster differently.
The *"Aliens"* scenario has the monster *buffed*, but also removes its ability to hop to new corpses; in this scenario, you can use a normal or weakened version of the monster, but you can also allow it to jump to new corpses.
This also allows you to use many more monster attacks: rather than deploying it cautiously, you can simply throw it at the party as often as you like (since it can just jump to a new corpse when destroyed, and since it won't do quite as much damage to them in its "un-toughened" state).

#### "Unsummoning" Details

- Don't toughen the monster.
- The monster can *reincarnate* with new corpses.
- The monster might *reincarnate* as ice if it runs out of corpses.
- analysis of the **notes at the traitor's desk** reveals that ritual can be "reversed".

#### Variant: Push it Through

In this variant, the monster needs to be lured into position, pushed through a magical aperture, or otherwise maneuvered during the climactic ritual.

Be careful with this one: the monster is both ferocious and intelligent, so it'll be tricky to pull off — especially if they don't have a *strong* combat character.

#### Variant: You Need the Original Ritual

In this variant, you can only reverse the ritual as long as you can use certain bits of the original ritual (like the diagram on the alter).

This produces a dangerous situation: the monster can foil the party if it destroys the **ritual remains**.
This introduces a *hard failure state*—unless you also arrange for a Plan B.

### Kill the Traitor

In this scenario, the monster is bound to the traitor; as long as the traitor is alive, the monster will jump from corpse to corpse, and the blizzard will remain.
But, if traitor is killed, the monster will be rendered vulnerable.
