title: "Building Characters"
---

The rules for Renaissance are very free-form; some people really enjoy
that, but some people can get lost with all the options they have. The
following is intended as a guide, to give players looking for a
foot-hold how to design, build and play their characters. These are not
rules, but guidelines; your own judgement will apply, as will your
desires for your character and the GM’s assessment of the situation.

## General Tips

  - Renaissance is a diverse game
    
      - D\&D focuses on combat; that’s where most of the rules and
        abilities go, and most of the game time is.
      - Renaissance is more diverse.
      - Combat, Social Scenes, Stealth, Crafting and Analysis are all
        balanced equally; so, for example, you’ll only spend 1/5 of your
        time in Combat.
      - As a *very* general rule, characters should be *excellent* at
        one of those things, and *good *at two others.

  - Characters should be Great in one area and Good in several.
    
      - Not too focused\! New players are often tempted to hyper-focus,
        getting 120 in like 3 related skills; this doesn’t work, because
        a) you can still roll a 21 and get beaten by a 34, and b) you’ll
        have nothing to do most of the time.
      - Not too spread out\! Getting 50-ish ratings in lots of skills
        can be unrewarding, because there’s nothing you’re really great
        at; when the pressure is on, the negative modifiers stack up and
        you can’t try again, you won’t be able to do anything with a
        base rating of 50.
      - Usually 2 skills over 70, 4 skills over 60 and 4 more skills
        over 50 is a pretty good balance.
      - Get skills from diverse areas.

## Character Archetypes

  - Archetypes are broad character concepts.
  - They generally refer to packages of skills, powers, classes and
    items that fit together.

  - Stealth:
    
      - Using powers like Sneak Attack, you can be effective at dealing
        damage, but Stealth characters often fare poorly in a stand-up
        fight.
    
      - Plays:
        
          - Sneaking into somewhere will likely be handled as an
            Infiltration vs. Perception test; be aware that some senses
            (like Scent) will make this much harder, or impossible.
          - Tailing someone who isn’t looking out for you will likely
            require one check, your Infiltration vs. their (passive)
            Perception.

  - Combat
    
      - Combat is very deadly, by design\! Damage is high and Wounds
        debilitate you quickly even if you don’t die. 
    
      - Healing is also hard, also by design—and “in combat” healing is
        a practical impossibility. One of the best healing abilities in
        the game, Heal, gives you Fast Healing 2; Binding a Wound is a
        10 Minute Task Action that only might work (and you only get to
        try once per wound).
    
      - It’s supposed to be this way. The idea is that combat should be
        rough on both sides, and even the winners should spend time
        after patching themselves up.
    
      - At least one high attack skill is obvious.
    
      - High Fray and good armor are very wise investments if you want
        to win (or survive) combat.
    
      - Also, having a plan for the after-combat “patching the team
        together” moment is a good idea.
        
          - The various Heal related powers are good, as are ranks in
            Medicine.
          - Potions are useful, but longer-term; healing happens slowly,
            and it can take days or even weeks to fully recover.
    
      - To make combat fun, on the other hand, a good weapon (a
        Significant Magic Item, probably) and some fun powers are
        recommended.
        
          - Who doesn’t enjoy a magical exploding hammer or a golem arm?
    
      - It applies to everyone, but it applies especially to combat
        characters; remember that you’ll only be in combat 20% of the
        time or so, and it’s a very good idea to have other things you
        can do. Skills like Knowledge: History \[Military History\],
        Profession: Soldier, Craft: Smithing, Craft: Chemistry (soldiers
        use potions and poisons, after all), Intimidate, Athletics and
        Protocol are all character-appropriate investments.
    
      - Aimed Shots can be very useful if you have a very high Attack
        skill. If your target number is over 90 after everything is
        added together, then you can easily absorb a -10 penalty in the
        name of having a chance to cut off a hand or gouge out an eye.

  - Magic-User
    
      - Magic-heavy characters can be very powerful and very flexible.
      - The abilities of Mages and Psions are easy to represent
        mechanically; simple take high ranks in Spellcraft or Control
        (or both), and take appropriate powers.
      - Clerics are a little trickier: Boons can be represented as
        granted powers or magical items (presumably granted by a
        spirit), but in general, the abilities of Clerics will be
        represented more “narratively.” Which is to say, wheras Mages
        and Psions will primarily represent their magical abilities with
        powers, Clerics will have to actually haggle with spirits—a
        process that has no specific rules, and is accomplished by
        roll-playing through it. See “dealing with a spirit” in Common
        Scenes.
      - While having a high Control or Spellcraft can be useful,
        remember that not every power requires a Control or Spellcraft
        check—or a check at all, for that matter. Fireball doesn’t
        require a check to manifest, and it requires a Thrown Weapons
        check to throw it\!

  - Social Butterfly
    
      - Remember that, in Renaissance, the player is expected to be
        proactive with checks. The GM will not always prompt you, “you
        can make a Read check now,” rather it is your responsibility to
        say, “I’d like to roll Read to see if I think he’s lying.” (If
        you don’t, then the GM may roll your Read for you, as a passive
        check—that is, with a penalty.)
    
      - Protocol’s use might not be immediately obvious; it lets you
        handle the social norms and expectations of a situation.
        
          - It can be useful while *preparing* for a social scene;
            Protocol can be used to determine what is expected of you.
          - Protocol can also be useful for *recovering gracefully* from
            an error; if you make a mistake, one your character never
            would have, a Protocol roll can play it off as a joke, or
            simple error, or otherwise make it seem trivial.
    
      - Barter is a little bit of an oddity; it’s a social skill that
        isn’t normally used in roll-playing. It’s used in very specific
        circumstances: specifically, when buying or selling goods.

  - Crafter
    
      - Crafters can produce things that the party needs.
      - Crafters have two major limits: they can only provide the party
        things that they know how to produce—that is, things they have
        the craft skills for—and crafting items can take time.
      - If you have Spellcraft and Craft: Smithing, then, during
        down-time, you can just take a month and build a magical hammer.
        But that takes raw materials and a month: if you’re in the
        middle of exploring an abandoned monastery, you can’t just
        produce a hammer.
      - Remember to buy a skill kit—you need to have tools to make
        things\!
      - The rules for crafting say that you need “raw materials,” but
        don’t provide a price for that; that’s because we don’t attempt
        to track how much raw materials cost or how much they weigh,
        across all the things that “raw materials” might mean. In
        general, if you are working in a well-stocked Shop, Raw
        Materials can be assumed; if you aren’t—for example, if you
        don’t own a shop, or are traveling lightly—you will need to
        purchase them. (Cost Minor is a good cost for raw materials,
        enough for several Minor items or one Moderate one. Major items,
        meanwhile, might require unique components, that must be tracked
        specifically.)

  - Scholar
    
      - Scholars are characters who *know things*. This can be very
        important in Renaissance, as an adventure might turn on being
        able to answer any of the following questions: what really
        happened 300 years ago (Knowledge: History), what might appease
        an angered spirit (Knowledge: Theology or Profession: Cleric),
        could the Commonwealth Army breach this fortification
        (Profession: Soldier), which noble line in the Eastern Kingdom
        was this knight loyal too (Knowledge: Noble Lineages).
      - Many adventures have an *investigation phase—*the party starts
        not knowing what’s going on, but having clues, and are then
        required to gather more evidence and figure out what’s going on.
        Scholars are the characters who take those clues and *figure out
        what’s going on*.
      - Scholars often also need Research. No one character knows
        everything, you’ll frequently have to *hit the books*.
      - Profession is also a knowledge skill; it represents knowing how
        a given field works. Profession: Soldier \[Command\] can be used
        to for military knowledge, for example, while Profession:
        Smuggler can be used to know how to smuggle items into or out of
        a city, or how to make a criminal contact
      - There are hopelessly many different areas of knowledge,
        especially considering all the different possible Interest and
        Profession skills that could exist. While the Scholar class can
        help with that, in general, the roll of “knowing things” needs
        to be spread across several different characters.

  - Backer
    
      - in a broad sense, referring to the rich trader or noble who can
        bank-roll the party.
        
          - One of the neat things about this game, IMO, is that this
            can be a player roll.
    
      - Similar to a crafter, their job is to provide the party with the
        things that they need. However, they do this by simply *buying*
        it.
    
      - On the up-side, buying something is fast; you can buy a sword
        much quicker than you can make it.
    
      - On the down side, you can’t always buy things: if you find an
        abandoned alchemist’s lab, a chemist could make something, but
        you can’t buy potions from it.
    
      - People with wealth and assets can also get noble audiences, hire
        help, or bribe guards, all of which can be very useful.
    
      - It’s a good idea to get several Trade Goods; any given trade can
        deplete one of them, so having more than one handy is useful.
    
      - Replenishing your Trade Goods is a good use of your Down Time.
    
      - Backer-type characters can also make good use of classes like
        Noble or General; you can use your title to get access to people
        who might not be available to the Common Folk.
        
          - Noble is a good choice for a Backer/Socialite, and General
            is a good choice for a Backer/Fighter.
    
      - Playing a Backer who operates using criminal connections can be
        very interesting; such connections can be very powerful, as they
        can net you services (like assassins) and goods (like black-mail
        information) that can’t be acquired any other way.
        
          - However, the consequences of being discovered could also be
            dire, and anything you acquire might come with strings
            attached—both situations good for roll-playing\!
          - Profession: Smuggler will be an important skill for such a
            character.
          - This is a good choice for Backer/Stealth characters.

## Common Scenes

  - “Standard Operating Procedures” for several common scenes.
    
      - These are especially not rules: the GM will adjust as
        appropriate.

  - Making Camp
    
      - Consume rations; remember to mark them down.
    
      - Heal up; declare who’s doing what to achieve that.
    
      - Keep watch: usually use two 4-hour watches.
        
          - Players who don’t get enough sleep will eventually begin to
            suffer penalties.
          - Keep Senses and Perception skill in mind when selecting
            watch.

  - Summoning a Spirit
    
      - Remember that spirits are *wildly* diverse; each area has its
        own spirits, no two of which will operate by exactly the same
        rules.
    
      - (Although there are also some very powerful spirits with very
        large basins; a Spirit associated with a mountain range might be
        known throughout, while each area of the range will have its own
        local, unique spirits.)
    
      - Remember that Spirits won’t cooperate with you just because you
        summoned them: make sure there’s some reason that the Spirit in
        question will actually do anything for you. Think about some
        reason that your interests align with its, or make sure there’s
        some propetiation you can make that it will want, or make sure
        you can bind it.
    
      - Remember also that Spirits are very powerful; they can offer
        powefull, game-changing boons, but an uncooperative spirit can
        also cause a *lot* of damage. Summoning a spirit is a good thing
        to do carefully, taking your time and spending Luck Points on.
        
          - Screwing up a Bind can be *particularly* bad.
    
      - Step 1: Research Local Spirits
        
          - if you aren’t a priest in the area, you probably don’t know
            how the local spirits operate; even if you are, checking the
            library for any “gotchase” is wise.
          - Probably an 8 hour Task Action, requiring a Research check,
            with Knowledge: Theology, Profession: Cleric, Profession:
            Shaman or similar as a related skill.
    
      - Step 2: Design the Ritual
        
          - a 4 hour Task Action, requiring a Profession: Cleric,
            Profession: Shaman or similar check.
          - Knowledge: Theology is a related skill, and an Exceptional
            or Critical Success on your Research test may help.
    
      - Step 3: Perform the Ritual
        
          - a one hour Task Action, requiring a Profession: Cleric,
            Profession: Shaman or similar check.
    
      - Step 4: Haggle\!
        
          - Once summoned—assuming it was summoned correctly—you can now
            bargain with the spirit. This is done in-character, using
            your social skills.

  - Researching a Clue
    
      - Many times, you’ll need access to information that you simply
        don’t have; you might need to know the history of one particular
        noble line, or the bind for one particular spirit.
    
      - Libraries exist throughout the Commonwealth, both public and
        private; one simple recourse is to simply look the information
        up.
    
      - With access to a library, you can research some particular topic
        with a 6 hour Task Action requiring a Research test; if you
        succeed, you gain useful information about the topic.
    
      - The quality of the library can complicate things; large
        libraries whose collections span many topics might take longer
        to search, while small or disorganized collections might apply a
        penalty.
    
      - And, of course, there’s a chance that the information you want
        simply won’t be written down—maybe not in the library you’re
        searching, maybe not anywhere.
        
          - An appropriate Knowledge check can be used to guess where
            (or whether) you can find the information you’re after, as
            can an appropriate Profession check.
    
      - After you’ve accumulated some useful information, you still need
        to *analyze* it; this is handled as a two-hour Task Action,
        requiring an appropriate Knowledge check.

  - Asking Around Town
    
      - Sometimes, you need information; you might need rumors, gossip,
        or just basic information about an unfamiliar town.
    
      - You can “ask around town” as a four hour Task Action, requiring
        a Protocol check; if you succeed, you might be rewarded with
        some basic information, or you might meet some interesting NPC
        (who might be willing to answer questions, might exchange
        information for coin, or might turn out to be important to the
        quest).
    
      - This procedure isn’t subtle; there’s a good chance people will
        remember “the one stranger snooping around”.
        
          - You can take a -20 penalty on your Protocol check to be
            discreet.
          - Of course, a good disguise might prevent this from being a
            problem all-together—unless you’re a member of a very rare
            race, or otherwise difficult to disguise.
    
      - You can make a Read check to gauge the trustworthiness of the
        people you’ve gathered information from.
    
      - You can make a Deception check to attempt to conceal your true
        motives and interests.

  - Getting an Audience
    
      - Those with connections can get the party in to see powerful and
        useful contacts—they can get audiences with nobles, generals or
        wealthy people of business.
    
      - How you go about setting up a meeting depends on the particulars
        of who you want to meet with: a Protocol check can be used to
        make a guess about whether or not a given person will meet with
        you, how you can go about setting that up, and what kind of
        leverage with them you might have.
        
          - Related skills like Interest: Noble Lines or Profession:
            City Administrator might help.
          - If you’re new in town, you might not have enough information
            to make the check; you might need to *ask around town
            *first, as above.
    
      - The procedure for setting up a meeting might vary: you might be
        able to walk into the contact’s estate and ask to be announced,
        you might have to arrange a clandestine meeting, or you might
        not be able to arrange an appointment at all.

  - Getting an Illegal Item
    
      - Able smugglers can use Profession: Smuggler to acquire things
        the party wants—common items, illegal items, the “services” of
        an assassin, information...
      - As a rough guide, you can work the docks and alleyways of a
        large town in search of someone with a valuable commodity as a 2
        Hour Task-Action requiring a Profession: Smuggler test (or
        similar).
      - If you succeed, you locate someone who has the thing you’re
        after.
      - You still have to pay for the item as normal (using Barter with
        either Trade Goods or money).
      - This can be dangerous: on a critical failure, you might run
        afoul of local law enforcement—or some other powerful enemy.
