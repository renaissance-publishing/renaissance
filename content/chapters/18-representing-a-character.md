## Characters

Characters are represented by the following:

- **Aptitudes**, which represent a character's fundamental mental abilities.
  - Each Aptitude has a *rating* between 5 and 40, representing your character’s ability with that aptitude.
  - Cognition (COG): your characters ability to analyze, reason and plan.
  - Coordination (COO): your character's ability to manage their posture and balance, and their reaction speed.
  - Intuition (INT): your character’s ability to master “unwritten rules” and pick up on subconscious queues.
  - Savvy (SAV): your character’s ability to manage social situations.
  - Somatics (SOM): your character’s ability to manage your body.
  - Willpower (WIL): your character’s self-discipline.
- A **race**, which represents your character's species.
  Your race gives you:
  - Durability and Strength scores,
  - aptitude bonuses,
  - senses and movement modes,
  - a size, and
  - special characteristics, like a Gnoll’s thick hide or a Shifter’s ability to change shape.
- A **background**, which represent where your character is from.
  - provides you with ranks in skills, and sometimes other benefits.
- Ranks in **skills**, which represent the things your character has learned to do.
- Dots in **languages**
- **Features**, including Traits, Powers, and Classes
  - **Traits** represent quirks your character has, like being ambidextrous
  - **Powers** represent special abilities that your character has, like a special sword maneuver that your character is good at, or the magical ability to manifest a ball of fire
  - **Classes** represent associations your characters has, which usually either represent some organization that you can call on for aide, or allow you “break a rule” in an interesting way.
- **Wealth**, **Wealth Dots** and **Items**, which represents your characters financial resources and possessions.
- **Motivations** and **Milestones**
- **Vital Statistics**, which are derived from your other choices:
  - Durability (DUR), which is determined by your race, possibly adjusted by effects or features
  - Wound Threhsold (WT)
    - DUR ÷ 5
  - Death Rating (DR)
    - DUR × 2
  - Lucidity (LUC)
    - WIL × 2
  - Trauma Threshold (TT)
    - LUC ÷ 5
  - Insanity Rating (IR)
    - LUC × 2
  - Initiative Score (INIT)
    - (INT + COO) ÷ 5
    - Well, that’s the *Combat* initiative score.
  - Damage Bonus (DB)
    - (SOM + STR) ÷ 10
  - Luck and Luck Points
    - (you start with 1 Luck, and can purchase more during character creation.)
  - Carrying Capacity
    - STR ÷ 5
    - see *Items*

- Some limits always apply. Characters may not have:
  - more than 70 ranks in a skill
  - an aptitude higher than 40 (any excess is wasted)
  - more than 10 Luck
  - more than 50 DUR or STR

[[clarification]]

|We sometimes refer to a character's racial abilities, traits, classes and powers collectively as their "features".

## Aptitudes

We use the following five **aptitudes** in *Renaissance*:

- Cognition (COG): a character's ability to analyze, reason and plan.
- Coordination (COO): a character's ability to manage their posture and balance, their ability to get their body into different configurations, and their reflexes.
- Intuition (INT): a character’s ability to pick up on patterns, to master “unwritten rules”, and to pick up on subconscious queues.
- Savvy (SAV): a character’s ability to manage social situations.
- Somatics (SOM): a character’s ability to manage their body.
- Willpower (WIL): a character’s self-discipline.

Each aptitude has a rating between 5 and 40, with 15 being considered average.
(Some characters don't have ratings in certain aptitudes; a formless creature, for example, might not have a SOM score.)

[[playerguidance | Somatics, the Mental Part of Strength]]
|
|Somatics (SOM) sounds like some kind of “mental strength score.”
|How does that make sense?
|
|Partly, that’s just to make the skill system work: some physical skills (like Unarmed Combat) need an attribute to be linked to — or else we’d need to build special cases for them into the rules.
|
|However, that’s also how the body *actually works*.
|The central nervous system has to learn to recruit and manage the muscles of the body, and some people really do learn to do this better than others\!

[[playerguidance | Does WIL Mater]]
|
|Players who read the skill section might notice that some aptitudes are linked to many more skills than others; notably, WIL is linked to only one skill — Control\!
|Does that mean that WIL doesn’t matter?
|
|Absolutely not\!
|WIL is used to determine your Lucidity (LUC) (and with it, your Trauma Threshold and Insanity Rating (your TT and IR).
|Also, WIL×3 checks are commonly used to resist fear and stress.

## Race

A character's race represents what species they are; are they a Drake, a Gnoll, a Human, or something else?

Different races have different physical abilities.
A character's race will generally also provide:
- their Durability (DUR) and Strength (STR) scores,
- bonuses to specific aptitudes,
- senses and movement modes,
- their size, and
- special characteristics and abilities.

Note that *race* and *culture* are separate, with race only representing those characteristics that are biologically innate, like claws or a keen sense of smell.

## Background

A character's **background** represents a character's culture — whether one they where raised in, or one that they have adopted.

Backgrounds will generally provide ranks in *skills* common to a specific culture; some may also include common items, traits, or other benefits.

## Features

Characters can also have **traits**, **powers**, and **classes** (which we sometimes collectively refer to as a character's **features**).

- **Traits** represent quirks your character has, like being ambidextrous
- **Powers** represent special abilities that your character has, like a special sword maneuver that your character is good at, or the magical ability to manifest a ball of fire
- **Classes** represent associations your characters has, which usually either represent some organization that you can call on for aide, or allow you “break a rule” in an interesting way.

## Wealth and Possessions

**Wealth**, **Wealth Dots** and **Items**, which represents your characters financial resources and possessions.
