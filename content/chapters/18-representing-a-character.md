## Characters

Characters are represented by the following:

- **Aptitudes**, which represent a character's fundamental mental abilities.
  - Each Aptitude has a *rating* between 1 and 40, representing your character’s ability with that aptitude.
  - Cognition (COG): your characters ability to analyze, reason and plan.
  - Coordination (COO): your character's ability to manage their posture and balance, and their reaction speed.
  - Intuition (INT): your character’s ability to master “unwritten rules” and pick up on subconscious queues.
  - Savvy (SAV): your character’s ability to manage social situations.
  - Somatics (SOM): your character’s ability to manage your body.
  - Willpower (WIL): your character’s self-discipline.
- A **race**, which represents your character's species.
  Your race gives you:
  - Durability and Strength scores,
  - aptitude bonuses,
  - senses and movement modes,
  - a size, and
  - special characteristics, like a Gnoll’s thick hide or a Shifter’s ability to change shape.
- A **background**, which represent where your character is from.
  - provides you with ranks in skills, and sometimes other benefits.
- Ranks in **skills**, which represent the things your character has learned to do.
- Dots in **languages**
- **Features**, including Traits, Powers, and Classes
  - **Traits** represent quirks your character has, like being ambidextrous
  - **Powers** represent special abilities that your character has, like a special sword maneuver that your character is good at, or the magical ability to manifest a ball of fire
  - **Classes** represent associations your characters has, which usually either represent some organization that you can call on for aide, or allow you “break a rule” in an interesting way.
- **Wealth**, **Wealth Dots** and **Items**, which represents your characters financial resources and possessions.
- **Luck** and **Luck Points**
- **Motivations** and **Milestones**
- **Vital Statistics**, including **Derived Statistics** that are determined based on the character's other statistics and attributes:
  - Durability and Strength scores
  - Wound Threhsold (WT): DUR ÷ 5
  - Death Rating (DR): DUR × 2
  - Lucidity (LUC): WIL × 2
  - Trauma Threshold (TT): LUC ÷ 5
  - Insanity Rating (IR): LUC × 2
  - Initiative Scores (INIT)
    - Different kinds of *initiative order* can have different initiative scores.
    - Your *combat initiative* is (INT + COO) ÷ 5
  - Damage Bonus (DB): (SOM + STR) ÷ 10
  - Carrying Capacity: STR ÷ 5

Some limits always apply.
Characters may not have:

- more than 70 ranks in a skill
- an aptitude higher than 40
- more than 10 Luck
- more than 50 DUR or STR

## Aptitudes

We use the following five **aptitudes** in *Renaissance*:

- Cognition (COG): a character's ability to analyze, reason and plan.
- Coordination (COO): a character's ability to manage their posture and balance, their ability to get their body into different configurations, and their reflexes.
- Intuition (INT): a character’s ability to pick up on patterns, to master “unwritten rules”, and to pick up on subconscious queues.
- Savvy (SAV): a character’s ability to manage social situations.
- Somatics (SOM): a character’s ability to manage their body.
- Willpower (WIL): a character’s self-discipline.

Each aptitude has a rating between 1 and 40, with 15 being considered average.

Some characters don't have ratings in certain aptitudes; a formless creature, for example, might not have a SOM score.
Characters don't have a rating in a certain aptitude will have a dash ("\-") listed for that aptitude in their description.

Some affects may raise or lower a character's aptitudes.
If an effect lowers an aptitude to 0, that will generally incapacitate a character; for example, lowering a character's COG to 0 might render them unconscious or irrational, while a lowering a character's SOM or COO to 0 might paralyze them.

[[playerguidance | Somatics, the Mental Part of Strength]]
|
|Somatics (SOM) sounds like some kind of “mental strength score.”
|How does that make sense?
|
|Partly, that’s just to make the skill system work: some physical skills (like Unarmed Combat) need an attribute to be linked to — or else we’d need to build special cases for them into the rules.
|
|However, that’s also how the body *actually works*.
|The central nervous system has to learn to recruit and manage the muscles of the body, and some people really do learn to do this better than others\!

[[playerguidance | Does WIL Mater]]
|
|Players who read the skill section might notice that some aptitudes are linked to many more skills than others; notably, WIL is linked to only one skill — Control\!
|Does that mean that WIL doesn’t matter?
|
|Absolutely not\!
|WIL is used to determine your Lucidity (LUC) (and with it, your Trauma Threshold and Insanity Rating (your TT and IR).
|Also, WIL×3 checks are commonly used to resist fear and stress.

## Race

A character's race represents what species they are; are they a Drake, a Gnoll, a Human, or something else?

Different races have different physical abilities.
A character's race will generally also provide:
- their Durability (DUR) and Strength (STR) scores,
- bonuses to specific aptitudes,
- senses and movement modes,
- their size, and
- special characteristics and abilities.

Note that *race* and *culture* are separate, with race only representing those characteristics that are biologically innate, like claws or a keen sense of smell.

## Background

A character's **background** represents a character's culture — whether one they where raised in, or one that they have adopted.

Backgrounds will generally provide ranks in *skills* common to a specific culture; some may also include common items, traits, or other benefits.

## Features

Characters can also have **traits**, **powers**, and **classes** (which we sometimes collectively refer to as a character's **features**).

- **Traits** represent quirks your character has, like being ambidextrous
- **Powers** represent special abilities that your character has, like a special sword maneuver that your character is good at, or the magical ability to manifest a ball of fire
- **Classes** represent associations your characters has, which usually either represent some organization that you can call on for aide, or allow you “break a rule” in an interesting way.

## Wealth and Possessions

**Wealth**, **Wealth Dots**, and **Items** represent your characters financial resources and possessions.

## Motivations and Milestones

Motivations and milestones represent a character's fundamental goals and guiding beliefs, and the significant events that have shaped them.

## Vital Statistics and Derived Statistics

Characters also have a number of **vital statistics**, many of which are derived from their aptitudes and other statistics (making them **derived statistics**).

| Derived Statistic  | Value |
| ------------------ | ----- |
| Wound Threshold (WT) | DUR ÷ 5 |
| Death Rating (DR) | DUR × 2 |
| Lucidity (LUC) | WIL × 2 |
| Trauma Threshold (TT) | LUC ÷ 5 |
| Insanity Rating (IR) | LUC × 2 |
| (Combat) Initiative Score (INIT) | (INT + COO) ÷ 5 |
| Damage Bonus (DB) | (SOM + STR) ÷ 10 |
| Carrying Capacity (CC) | STR ÷ 5 |

Note that, when your aptitudes or statistics change, any of the other statistics *derived* from them also change.
So, for example, if something changes your *SOM*, your *damage bonus* will also change.

## Minor NPCs

NPCs, especially minor NPCs, may be missing some of these attributes.
In particular:

- Minor NPCs don't have *luck* or *luck points*.
- NPCs often don't have *backgrounds*.
- Minor NPCs often don't have wealth dots (but they can have items and trade goods).
- Minor NPCs often don't have motivations or milestones.

## "Global" Limits

Some limits always apply; we call these "global limits".

Characters may not have:
- more than 70 ranks in a skill
- an aptitude higher than 40
- more than 10 Luck
- more than 50 DUR or STR

If an effect would increase a statistic past its global limit, any excess is wasted.
