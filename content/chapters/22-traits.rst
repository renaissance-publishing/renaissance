The exact boundary between a Trait (covered in this chapter), a Class
and a Power (in the following chapters) might be confusing. In general:

-  A **trait** represents an *innate* property that your character has,
   like being particularly brave or having unusually fast reflexes.
   Importantly, traits aren’t actions (like powers), and traits usually
   aren’t acquired through experience (like classes).
-  A **power** represents a unique ability that your character can
   perform. Powers usually *are* discrete actions (even a sustained
   action is still an action that you’re consciously performing at some
   times and not others). Also, powers often *are* learned: they often
   represent a “trick” that your character has drilled to perfection,
   possibly with the aid of magical preparation or mundane set-up.
-  **Classes** are a little more variable. Classes often represent an
   *experience* that you have had.

   -  Very often, they represent a membership you have (or have had) in
      some organization—which might have given you some special
      training, or might give you access to their resources. These
      Classes commonly take two forms: they either let you “break the
      rules” in some interesting way (like the *Channeler*) or they give
      you access to an organization’s resources (like *Guild Member*).
   -  More rarely, Classes can give a character a “feature”.
      *Corpse-Herder* and *Familiar-Bound Mage* are examples. Both
      conceptually and mechanically, these are a little awkward: they’re
      classes essentially because they’re not *traits* (since they’re
      not innate), and they’re not *powers* (because they aren’t
      discrete actions—“having a magical pet” isn’t really an action
      that you perform). They’re closest to an experience that you’ve
      had—the experience of “having made a magical companion.”

A final note on classes: we’ve tried to avoid adding things that *should
be* traits or *should be* powers as part of what you get from a class;
we much prefer that the trait or class be a separate thing—one that has
the given class as a prerequisite. (Every attendant at a given shrine
might have a certain power, for example, but it’s preferable to list the
power separately from the shrine-attendant class.)

Traits
------

Traits represent special properties about your character—good, neutral
and bad. Maybe they’re ambidextrous, maybe they have a reputation, or
maybe they’re blind? All these things are Traits.

Traits are most commonly acquired by buying them with CP during
character creation; sometimes, they can be acquired during character
advancement, or awarded during an adventure.

What Makes a Good Trait
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Designing a good trait is tricky. They’re not like Backgrounds, which
(for the most part) include a number of benefits equal to a fixed cost
in CP. Instead, designing a good (and balanced!) trait is far more
subjective.

It’s important to understand the difference between what should be a
class, a trait, and a power, and it’s important to heed the general
advice for designing new elements (avoid something that completely
eclipses other options, that negates the need for a skill, or that
trivializes a role). After that, your best bet is to compare your new
trait to the ones that already exist; in particular, make sure that it’s
different enough from the traits that already exist (otherwise it
probably isn’t worth the effort), and that it’s not wildly more or less
powerful (or valuable, in CP terms) than the other options.

Positive Traits
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some traits are *positive*—that is, they provide a benefit.

-  Alert: You are particularly aware of your surroundings. You take no
   penalty to passive Perception tests.

-  Ambidextrous: Choose one of your limbs: you may now use that limb as
   adroitly as you can use your dominant hand.

   -  Notably, this means that the penalties for using an Off-Handed
      Weapon would not apply when using that hand.
   -  Note that this trait is not specific to an arm: an Elf could use
      to to be able to handle a weapon (without offhand penalties) with
      one of their prehensile feet, for example.

-  Brave: your character receives a +20 bonus to tests to resist fear or
   intimidation

-  Common Sense: you know a good idea (or a bad one!) when you see it.
   Once per game, you may ask the GM whether some particular action is a
   *good idea* or not; alternatively, the GM may warn you that something
   you are about to do is a *bad idea*.

-  Disciplined: You are particularly good at self-control. You may spend
   1 luck to reroll a check that includes your WIL.

-  High Pain Tolerance: your character can *negate* the effect of one
   wound.

-  Limber: Your character is very lithe, and receives a +10 bonus on
   checks where this would be beneficial, such as trying to escape
   bindings or squeeze through tight spaces.

-  Ready: you may spend a Luck Point to re-roll your initiative.

-  Resilient: you are particularly mentally durable. You can negate one
   Trauma.

-  Social Animal: you are particularly well-suited to large groups and
   complex social situations. You may spend a Luck Point to reroll a
   social skill check.

-  Strong: you are particularly strong. This increases your STR by 5.

-  Thrifty

   -  You have a knack for getting the most out of your money.
   -  You have one additional wealth dot at each level.

-  Tough: you are particularly tough. This increases your DUR by 5.

Deathless
^^^^^^^^^

Your heroic defiance can even delay death for a time.

-  **Requires:** Defiance, 25 WIL
-  **Benefit:** When your damage exceeds your DR, you may continue to
   act normally for WIL÷5 rounds. During this time, your heroic resolve
   is astonishing: your wounds and traumas are *negated*. At the end of
   this duration, you die as normal.
-  **Design Note:** no test is required, because you die at the end; how
   sad would it be to carry this trait around for a character’s entire
   life and then fail to activate it at the end?

Defiance
^^^^^^^^

You are defiant in the face of injury and agony.

-  **Requires:** 20 WIL
-  **Benefit:** When your damage exceeds your DUR, you have a chance to
   continue to act for a short time (instead of losing consciousness
   immediately, like you normally would). When you damage exceeds your
   DUR, roll WIL×3; if you succeed, you may remain conscious for WIL÷5
   rounds.

Negative Traits
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some traits are *negative traits*. A negative trait imposes a *penalty,*
but taking it *gives* you more CP to spend during character creation.

-  Congenital Defect: you have some congenital defect; choose one from
   the list below:

   -  *TBD*

-  Distinctive: you have some very distinctive characteristic, which
   makes you very recognizable. You take a -20 penalty on Disguise
   checks, and on Stealth checks to blend into a crowd.
-  Enemy: some foe is determined to see you fall. They might be someone
   who is actively hunting you, they might be someone in a position of
   power who will make your life miserable at every opportunity, or they
   might be something else. In any case, they are a frequent source of
   frustration for you, showing up to foil your plans at the worst
   possible times.
-  Frail: you are not as hardy as other members of your race. This
   decreases your DUR by 5; this alters your DR and WT as well. You
   cannot take both this trait and the Tough trait.
-  Illiterate: You cannot read or write.
-  Impaired Sense: your character has poor vision, poor hearing, or one
   of their other senses is impaired. You suffer a -10 penalty to one of
   your senses (choose one when you take this trait).
-  Meek: No-one would describe you as “brave”: you have a -20 penalty to
   tests to resist fear or intimidation. You cannot take both this and
   the Brave trait.
-  Old Injury: you have an old injury. Choose one from the list below:

   -  *tbd*

-  Sensory Loss: your character is blind, deaf, or otherwise lacks some
   sense (that they would normally have). Choose one sense for which you
   have the Impaired Sense trait; you loose this sense.
-  Social Stigma: you are part of a group, organization or movement that
   people have a negative view of. You take penalties on Social skills
   (these skills depend heavily on the situation, and are up to GM
   discression). These penalties should apply at least some of the time
   where you live.
-  Wanted: you are wanted by some government, order or noble. You
   occasionally have to hide from bounty-hunters, duck guards, or worry
   about being turned in by any less-than-scrupulous people you
   encounter.
-  Weak: you are weaker than the norm for your race. You have -5 STR.
   You cannot take both this and the Strong trait.

Neutral Traits
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some traits are *neutral*, giving you both a benefit and a drawback;
they do not cost or provide CP.

-  Hardened: You have been exposed to some source of stress repeatedly,
   and have become resistant to it; however, doing so has taken a toll.

   -  Choose one particular source of stress: you gain +WIL to checks
      made to resist it, but your Luck stat is reduced by 1.
   -  Example sources of stress include *being gravely injured in
      combat; failing one of your motivational goals spectacularly;
      witnessing, experiencing or performing torture* and *displays of
      extreme supernatural power.*

-  Unique Outlook: You have some personal philosophy or outlook that
   causes you to process some situation vary differently than other
   people do; on the plus side, this allows you to weather some
   situations that others would find stressful—but on the down side,
   your unusual outlook makes it harder for others to relate to you.

   -  Choose one particular source of Stress: you gain +WIL to checks
      made to resist it, but you suffer a -10 penalty to Persuasion and
      Protocol tests.

Smaller
^^^^^^^

You are much smaller than average for your race; reduce your size
category by one “step” (e.g. from Medium to Small).

This affects your movement(s). Most of your movements are reduced:
reduce your base rate(s) by 1m and your full rate(s) by 3m. Some
movements—like flight—might benefit from you being smaller, however:
with your GM’s approval, you may increase these movements by 1m/3m.

Though we do not have extensive rules for size, this may have other
effects: see *Size* in *Senses, Movements and Special Abilities*.

Larger
^^^^^^

You are much larger than average for your race; increase your size
category by one “step” (e.g. from Small to Medium).

This affects your movement(s). Most of your movements are increased:
increase your base rate(s) by 1m and your full rate(s) by 3m. Some
movements—like flight—might be hindered by you being larger, however: at
your GM’s discretion, some of your movements will instead be reduced by
1m/3m.

Though we do not have extensive rules for size, this may have other
effects: see *Size* in *Senses, Movements and Special Abilities*.
