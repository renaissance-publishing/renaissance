<p>Classes are somewhat variable; in principle, they represent either some association or experience that your character has (or had).
As such, they usually grant you either access to some group's resources, or to some unique talent or training.</p>
<p>In practice, though, classes can become something of a catch-all — a very diverse type of feature that represents things that are not innate properties (like traits) or discrete actions (like powers).</p>
<div class="asside">
<div class="asside-title">What Makes a Good Class</div>
<p>Much as with traits, what makes a good class is highly subjective — and classes are even more tricky, since they are so variable.
As with traits, it's a good idea to understand what the difference between a trait, a class and a power is, and to understand the general guidelines for creating new content.
Notably, a class <em>shouldn't</em> give a character an action that they can perform or an innate property that they have: those should be separate powers or traits, respectively, although that separate power or trait can list the class as a requirement.</p>
<p>There is one general rule that's worth pointing out specifically for classes: a class should not be &quot;mandatory&quot; for a given character concept (&quot;mandatory&quot; here meaning that anyone building a particular character concept would always choose to take that class).
Classes also shouldn't represent something that any expert in a field would know how to do: someone with 50 ranks in Spellcraft is a master mage, even if they've taken no Classes at all.</p>
<p>Unlike traits, Classes commonly have requirements: 20 ranks in skills is often a good requirement for a &quot;basic&quot; class (a class that doesn't require any other feature).
&quot;Advanced&quot; classes (classes that require other features) can have higher skill requirements (although they don't have to).</p>

<li>Requirements: 30 Ranks in Spellcraft, the Corpse-Herder class</li>
<li>You can modify your corpse companion. Such a modification
requires time, raw materials and an appropriate Spellcraft
check. Possible modifications are listed below:</li>
<li>Armored: your companion gains 4 armor. Requires: 1 hour
task-action, a corpse, scraps of armor.</li>
<li>Monstrous: you heavily strengthen and reinforce your companion,
which gains +5 STR and +10 DUR. Requires: 1 hour task-action,
two corpses.</li>
<li>Hulk: your companion is a heavily-armored hulk capable of
shrugging off massive damage. Its gains 6 more armor (so that it

<li>You are a devotee of the Mourner, and you have pledged yourself

similar), or while pursuing a perpetrator of cruelty or
injustice on a great scale, before making a Combat skill check,

<p>Corpse-Herder</p>

<li>Requirement: 20 Ranks in Spellcraft, 10 ranks in Knowledge:
Theology</li>
<li>You can create a powerful companion from the remains of the
dead — and you can heal and modify your companion with more
remains.</li>

Spellcraft check; you need access to at least one corpse (of
medium size or larger) to provide raw material.</li>

not come from the corpse you used.)</li>
<li>Your companion will obey any simple command you give it; absent
orders from you, it will follow you and defend you.</li>
<li>When you create your companion, you may distribute 200 ranks
among its various skills. You cannot assign it more than ten
ranks in any Knowledge skill, and you cannot assign it more
ranks in a skill than you have.</li>
<li>Your companion has the Supernatural tag, and does not need to
eat, drink, sleep or breath. It is unaffected by poison and
disease (though it can carry diseases).</li>
<li>Your companion doesn’t heal naturally, and Medicine is useless
on it. However, you may attempt to repair it if it is damaged.
If you have a corpse to work with, you may attempt to repair it;
this is a thirty-minute Task Action requiring a Spellcraft
check. If you succeed, one wound is removed, and your companion
recovers 1d10 DV. (Note, the wound is <em>removed</em>, not bound.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>

<li>Familiars are small magical assistants, bound to the mage that they serve.</li>

<h4 id="drilled-fighter"><a class="header" href="#drilled-fighter">Drilled Fighter</a></h4>
<p>You have drilled some set of combat maneuvers to the point that they have become wrote.
On the plus side, this allows you to perform complex <em>chains</em> efficiently and powerfully;
on the down side, however, this means that someone who is familiar with these chains — possibly because they've fought you before, or because they're familiar with the school or unit you learned them from — can reliably predict what you're going to do.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Requires:</strong> 20 ranks in two <em>Combat</em> skills.</li>
<li><strong>Effect:</strong> You can learn a number of <em>chains</em>; each chain provides bonuses that build with each successful step.</li>
<li><strong>Special:</strong> When you acquire this class, you get two chains.  You may purchase more chains for 5 CP (during character creation) or 5 Rez (while leveling) per chain.  You may have up to 6 chains.</li>
<li><strong>Chain Basics</strong>
<ul>
<li>Each chain consists of between 3 and 5 individual steps, or <em>links</em>.</li>
<li>Each <em>link</em> has an associated bonus; when you successfully complete a link, you gain its bonus.  (The last link doesn't have a bonus, because there isn't a following link for it to apply to.)</li>
<li>The power of a chain lies in your ability to carry through it rapidly and precisely; you must proceed from link to link without interruption, or the chain is broken and the benefits are lost.  A chain is <em>interrupted</em> if you take an action that is not part of the chain, or go through a turn without performing a link.</li>
<li>Some actions by other characters may also interrupt your chain; it does not necessarily interrupt your chain if you are successfully attacked, but it would interrupt your chain if you where <em>knocked down</em> as a result of an attack.</li>
<li>Taking a <em>Reaction</em> interrupts the chain.  Since defending with Fray isn't a reaction, you can do that without interrupting the chain; since parrying is a reaction, parrying will break the chain, unless you're fulfilling a Defend link.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Creating Chains</strong>
<ul>
<li>to create a chain, simply pick between 3 and 5 links from the list below, and then pick a bonus for each link (except the last).</li>
<li>You must specify the details of each <em>link</em>.  For a strike, for example, you must specify the weapon you're using and the angle of the attack; for a motion, you must specify the movement mode, and how far you're moving.
You don't have to go into exhausting detail, you just need to provide enough information so that you and the GM can tell what has clearly satisfied the requirements of the link and what has not.
(For example, &quot;I step back a space,&quot; &quot;I thrust forward with my sword,&quot; &quot;I make a rising block,&quot; and so on)</li>
<li>Some bonuses have special restrictions or requirements.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Clarification:</em> chains take several actions and will usually span several turns; a chain doesn't allow you to shoot through all the links in one turn.</li>
<li><strong>Special:</strong> Players may propose their own links and bonuses, although these require the GM's approval.</li>
<li><strong>Flourishes:</strong> You don't pick a bonus for the last link, since there's no following link for it to apply to; you can, however, pick a <em>flourish</em> for it.
A <em>flourish</em> is represents some minor movement that completes the chain — a return-to-ready motion, a specific stance, a weapon twirl, or some other minor touch.
Mechanically, flourishes provide a minor benefit for completing the chain.
Sample flourishes are given in the table below.</li>
</ul>
<table><thead><tr><th>Link</th><th>Effect</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Strike</td><td>You attack with a given weapon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Step</td><td>You move with one of your movement modes. (You can specify how far.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Stunt</td><td>You perform a difficult stunt.  (This could range from something as simple as a forward roll to something as complex as a spinning flip.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Maneuver</td><td>You perform a given <em>combat maneuver</em></td></tr>
<tr><td>Defend</td><td>You defend against an attack (with Fray, by parrying, or some other way; you must specify which).</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<table><thead><tr><th>Bonus</th><th>Effect</th><th>Requirement</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Might</td><td>the next Strike or Maneuver in the chain gains +DB DV</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Precision</td><td>You gain +10 to <em>attack</em> skill checks require by the rest of the chain.</td><td>can only be taken up to twice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Deftness</td><td>Your next Step or Stunt does not provoke</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Evasion</td><td>You gain +10 to your defense checks for the rest of the chain.</td><td>can only be selected up to twice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Sway</td><td>You gain +30 to your defense checks against a specified target until after the next link.</td><td></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<table><thead><tr><th>Flourish</th><th>Effect</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Display</td><td>You adopt a visually striking stance, twirl a weapon, or otherwise demonstrate your prowess — which is all the more effective because you've just run through a chain.  You can roll your <em>Intimidate</em> against your opponent's Resist Social Manipulation; if you win, they suffer a -10 penalty to their attacks against you.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Ready</td><td>Your chain ends with you in an advantageous, ready position; you gain a +10 bonus to your <em>Combat</em> skills until the end of your next turn.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Initiative</td><td>You've put your opponent in a difficult position, put them off-balance, or otherwise stumbled them.  Your opponent reduces their INIT by 3.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<h4 id="missile-hurler"><a class="header" href="#missile-hurler">Missile-Hurler</a></h4>
<p>Through long practice and physical conditioning, you have developed an excellent stance and strong throwing arm.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Requires:</strong> 20 ranks in Ranged Weapons, with the Thrown Weapons proficiency</li>
<li><strong>Effect:</strong> Range and damage when throwing projectiles is improved.
<ul>
<li>Your range is improved:
<ul>
<li>When throwing a small object — about the size and weight of a brick, or smaller — you add 20m to each range increment.</li>
<li>When throwing a larger object, you add 10m to each range increment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Your damage is improved:
<ul>
<li>When attacking a target in your short range, you gain +DB DV and +2 AP.</li>
<li>When attacking a target in your medium range, gain +1 DV and +1 AP.</li>
<li>This does not apply to weapons that don't do damage through impact — like fireballs or scour canisters.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These effects are summarized in the table below.
These are only the &quot;base&quot; ranges; they may still be adjusted by the nature of the object and the situation, as normal.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>object</th><th>short</th><th>medium</th><th>long</th><th>extreme</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td><em>without this class</em></td><td>5m</td><td>15m</td><td>30m</td><td>45m</td></tr>
<tr><td>small object</td><td>25m, +DB DV, +2 AP</td><td>35m, +1 DV, +1 AP</td><td>50m</td><td>65m</td></tr>
<tr><td>large object</td><td>15m, +DB DV, +2 AP</td><td>25m, +1 DV, +1 AP</td><td>45m</td><td>55m</td></tr>

<ul>
<li><strong>Requirements:</strong> 10 ranks in Intimidate, 10 ranks in Persuasion</li>
<li><strong>Effect:</strong> You gain a +10 bonus to Social skill checks related to <em>challenging others,</em> <em>focusing attention on yourself,</em> and <em>boasting.</em>  Those who refuse a challenge may be <em>demoralized,</em> and will suffer a -10 penalty to checks related to the challenge.</li>

<p>You are a member of an organization, like one of the ones listed in <em>Organizations</em>.

<ul>
<li><strong>Effect:</strong> You are a member of an <em>organization</em>, gaining access to the organization's resources, but also accepting an obligation to the organization.
<ul>
<li>Players and GMs should work together to detail the player's organization; the GM's final approval is required.</li>
<li>Organizations generally shouldn't be so powerful that they trivialize the game or make it impossible to threaten the characer — that's too powerful.  However, the player should also gain some benefit from being in the organization — they're paying CP for the class, after all.</li>
<li>Membership in an organization should also impose some obligations on the character — for example, a commercial guild might require its members to pay dues, and to maintain a good reputation (so as to not tarnish the reputation of other members of the guild).</li>
