<p>The following races have large populations, and can be found throughout the Commonwealth.
Most of these races take pride in belonging to one or both of the following groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>The &quot;founding races,&quot; the races that founded the Commonwealth: that is, Humans, Gnolls, and Halflings.</li>
<li>The &quot;pillar races,&quot; the major racial and cultural groups that dominate the Commonwealth today: that is, Drakes, (Ash) Elves, Gnolls, Humans, and Kobolds.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="drakes"><a class="header" href="#drakes">Drakes</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Though it was long known that the Drakes where a created people, it
was only a few hundred years ago, as power devolved to the people in
the Dragonshire and as their alliance with the Commonwealth drew
closer, that their true origin was revealed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More than a century before the Old Charter, after Karrach claimed a
swath of the Empire of Man, it had become apparent to him that he
could not govern such a large territory on his own.</p>
<ul>
<li>He had called other dragons to him, to share the rule of his
kingdom as his lords and vassals, but dragons, though long-lived
and mighty, where also few, and had little shared culture or
history before his kingdom. Karrach need a <em>people</em>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Karrach, aided by the dragons who answered his call, began a search
for a powerful spirit willing to provide him a great boon — for a
great price.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ultimately, a spirit contacted him; it variably identified itself as <em>the Bulrush God</em>, <em>the Rainstorm Shepherd</em> and <em>the Osprey’s Father</em>, and it dwelt within the southern reaches of the Dragonshire.</li>
<li>The spirit’s actual basin remains unknown, as does the extent of
its powers; they are certainly great, given what it did.</li>
<li>It gave Karrach and his followers instructions for creating holy
sites — only the precious first few of which it has actually
blessed — and a ritual they could perform there. The ritual would
convert a dragon’s egg into a drake’s egg — drakes being creatures
of dragon’s blood and kind, but smaller, less mighty and far
more fertile.</li>
<li>The price the Bulrush God demanded was perhaps surprisingly
cheap for what it did: it demanded ownership of a stretch of
lowland marsh on the southern coast of the Dragonshire, fully 20
kilometers along the coast and extending 7 kilometers inland,
and a lordly title.</li>
<li>This represented an enormous risk for Karrach, as he knew of no
way to bind the spirit, which was unknown to him.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Bulrush God is still worshiped in the Dragonshire.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Bulrush God is enigmatic; very little is known about it,
neither its actual basin nor the true extent of its powers nor
its ultimate goals.</li>
<li>The Bulrush God answers very few supplicants; it is not known
what draws it. No bind for it is known — unsurprisingly, for a
spirit of its power.</li>
<li>Conversely, the Bulrush God interferes little in the affairs of
mortals and lesser spirits. Particularly, it has never used its
lordly title, and it has not allowed settlement of the land it
claims, and so has no subjects. (Neither has it forbidden the
land to hunters or travelers, leading many to wonder what its
actual intent with it was.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drakes frequently trace their lineages back to their Dragon
forebears.</p>
<ul>
<li>Each egg needed to be live; thus, all Drakes have at least two
dragon ancestors, one male and one female.</li>
<li>The ritual to transform an egg required a price of each
participant dragon; it was not undertaken lightly.</li>
<li>Though Drakes can nominally be broken into clans based on their
lineage, their family trees where often rendered <em>complex</em> by
feudal politics; for some, their clan and heritage are important
parts of who they are; other drakes care little — or may not even
know their ancestry at all.</li>
<li>Many Drake clans (or smaller noble families) claim noble titles
and land-holdings — at least in principle.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the early days of the Dragonshire, when they were a feudal
territory (and most of the feudal lords were dragons), Drakes tended
to take positions of authority, above Humans but below Dragons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As political reforms took place, the role of Drakes, Dragons and
Human leaders changed. The modern Dragonshire is a Commonwealth
province, and power has been devolved from the hereditary nobility
(of Drakes and Dragons) to civil Councils.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Still, Drakes largely think of themselves as being of “noble blood”,
and many of them still hold hereditary titles – which may or may not
be of practical significance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even though power in the Dragonshire has been devolved to civil
councils, having the right lineage still helps: Drakes commonly hold
positions of privilege and authority in the Dragonshire.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because their culture is similar to that of the feudal Kingdoms of
Man, Drakes find it fairly easy to interact politically with that
neighboring state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drakes commonly serve in units of the Commonwealth Military that
draw from the citizenry of the Dragonshire</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Somewhat like Gnolls, Drakes also commonly take up jobs where their
immense strength is an asset. However, because Drakes are much more
comfortable in large cities, this tends to mean “blacksmithing” more
often than it means “farm work”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drakes tend to be good-natured and sociable at best, but also brash,
proud and stubborn at worst.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Appearance: Drakes are humanoid in gross layout, but they have the
head, long tail, powerful limbs, tough scales and sharp claws of
Dragons.</p>

<h3 id="elves"><a class="header" href="#elves">Elves</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Elves are a common people throughout the Emerald Plains.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Elves are humanoid in gross layout, although they have finer
features (including long, pointed ears).</p>
<ul>
<li>Elves have excellent hearing and vision.</li>
<li>Notably, elves are descended from arboreal creatures, and retain
prehensile feet. These are larger than human feet, owing to
being reinforced with extra tendons, bones and musculature;
thanks to this reinforcement, Elves can run on open ground as
well as humans.</li>
<li>Elves also have exotic skin pigmentations, which help them to
blend in to natural environments.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are three major Elven ethnic groups: Wood Elves, Shade Elves
and Ash Elves.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wood Elves are a tribal culture, dispersed throughout the
northwestern portion of the Emerald Plane.</p>
<ul>
<li>Wood Elves do not have a large, overarching nation; their tribes
are usually more similar to nearby tribes of other races than to
distant Wood Elves.</li>
<li>The Commonwealth’s interactions with wood elves have, for the
most part, been peaceful; by the present day, the majority of
the wood elf tribes have signed the Commonwealth Charter (and
now the Commonwealth Compact).</li>
<li>However, most wood elf communities continue to practice
traditional, tribal ways of life; they live within the vast
interior swaths of the Emerald Plane, having little contact with
outsiders, even though they are technically Commonwealth
citizens.</li>
<li>Because of this, wood elves are rarely seen outside of their
tribal communities.</li>
<li>Wood Elves typically live in small settlements, with a few
planted fields around them. The able-bodied typically herd or
hunt, while the very young, the very old and the infirm live in
their settlements.</li>
<li>Wood Elves have a complex skin pattern, a little like an ocelot.
Their bellies, underarms and inner thighs are a dull white,
while their backs, arms and legs are a dark green. Running
through this is a complex pattern of black spots and folding and
curving lines. Their hair is often dark green or black; rarely,
it is gold or orange.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shade Elves are plains raiders hailing from the open plains on the
southwest of the Emerald Plane.</p>
<ul>
<li>Before the arrival of the Commonwealth, they preyed on the
peoples and cultures near them, forcing some to pay tribute and
raiding the others without mercy.</li>
<li>As the Commonwealth spread West and entered the Shade Elves’
territory, some of the tribes they had preyed upon allied with
those Commonwealth settlers.</li>
<li>The Commonwealth built a string of walled cities and fortified
keeps on the path to the sea; after a disastrous siege led to a
losing war, the Shade Elves’ territory was severely restricted.</li>
<li>This left the Shade Elves vulnerable to the Leapers, a
subterranean race that overwhelmed their largest settlements and
forced the Shade Elves to pay them tribute.</li>
<li>The Leapers later forced the Shade Elves to cooperate with their
other tributaries, the Ratfolk of the Warren Isles; the
resulting union came to be called the Shaded Sea Peoples, named
for the sea that separated the Warren Isles from the Shade
Elves’ territory on the southwest of the continent.</li>
<li>Shade Elves are still raiders, striking at settlements on the
edge of the Commonwealth and on the northwest of the Raptor’s
Plane.</li>
<li>They also participate in piracy, carried by Ratfolk ships and
sailors.</li>
<li>As members of the Shaded Sea Peoples, they are one of the
Emerald Plane’s great powers, and an enemy of the Commonwealth.
They have been in conflict with the Commonwealth off-and-on for
centuries.</li>
<li>Shade Elves live in small settlements dug into the bases of
hills and the sides of mesas and river-valleys. Their
settlements are usually fortified and walled, both to help
fending of rebellions by their tributaries and predation at the
hands of other Shade Elf clans.</li>
<li>Shade Elven skin is striped, a little like a tiger or zebra. The
stripes alternate between a dark black and a dull grey. Shade
Elven hair is similarly black and grey.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ash Elves are urban, thoughtful and philosophical people; they are
the descendants of Shade and Ash Elves who settled in the Haven
Isles.</p>
<ul>
<li>Many trace the origins of the Ash Elves to the siege of
Islandholme by the Shade Elves in CY 447 and its aftermath, as
Shade Elves taken hostage in the siege where slowly ingtegrated
into the Commonwealth and interbred with Wood Elves.</li>
<li>Ash Elven settlements have also absorbed many refugees from the
tumult and cruelty of Shade Elven culture, and have served as a
familiar home for Wood Elves wishing to join a more urban
culture.</li>
<li>Ash Elven culture was formed in the cities of the Haven Isles,
influenced by the countless other traditions brought there by
settlers from the rest of the Commonwealth.</li>
<li>Ash Elves are a very thoughtful people, and they are avid
consumers of literature, art, law, philosophy, and other forms
of scholarship. They also tend to be highly eclectic in the
scholarship they consume, drawing for the intellectual
traditions of races and cultures throughout the commonwealth.</li>
<li>Ash Elven culture is disciplined, mindful and meditative; they
are often reserved, stoic in the face of danger, but vibrant and
joyous in time of celebration.</li>
<li>Ash Elves tend to prefer urban environs, and can be found
throughout the Commonwealth’s large cities.</li>
<li>Ash Elves have also built cities of their own; they tend to
build large underground settlements, somewhat like those
constructed by Dwarves and Kobolds.</li>
<li>Ash Elven culture is open, egalitarian and libertine; guests are
welcome and well-treated, and they tend to get along well with
their neighbors — especially dwarves and kobolds.</li>
<li>They are particularly known for the joyous celebrations that
mark their holidays, in which their cities are brightly
decorated and travelers and neighbors are welcome.</li>
<li>Ash Elves tend to be strong advocates for the Commonwealth’s
continued peaceful expansion.</li>
<li>Ash Elven skin is mostly the color of ash, as the name implies;
they have a few stripes along their backs, the tops of their
arms, and the outside of their legs. The stripes are thing, and
alternate between white and black. Their hair is often black,
ash grey, pale white or ember orange.</li>

<h3 id="gnolls"><a class="header" href="#gnolls">Gnolls</a></h3>
<p>Gnolls are one of the most numerous races on the Emerald Plane; much like Humans and Elves, they have long lived throughout the Emerald Plane.
Almost as sociable as humans and incredibly strong, Gnollish strength (and endurance) was the backbone of the early Commonwealth.</p>
<p>Gnolls are roughly humanoid in gross layout, but they have hyena-like features:
their head and feet are much like a hyena's;
they are covered in short, ochre fur much like a hyena's;
and they have a hyena's short tail.
Gnolls are also much larger and stronger than most other races — Drakes are perhaps the only common race that can exceed them.
Notably, Gnolls display less sex dimorphism than most other races do; as a result, Gnollish cultures tend to place less importance on an individual's sex.</p>
<p>Gnolls where one of the three races that cooperated under the auspices of the Old Charter to create the growing, prosperous culture of towns, manors and cities that would eventually become the Commonwealth.
When Gnollish refugees where granted a manor's charter by the Lord of a Human city, a new and unique culture was created, at least as similar to the urban Human culture that sheltered them as to any prior Gnollish culture;
this Gnollish culture was one of the ones that was spread west as the Commonwealth expanded, and that is still one of the Commonwealth's most common and distinctive cultures today.</p>
<p>Commonwealth Gnolls tend to be somewhat rural; they are common in the small villages and towns of the Commonwealth, but rare in its cities.
Though the idea of a Gnollish farmer may seem odd to some, they are in fact well-suited to it; their great strength and endurance is invaluable for farming work, and the <em>flexibility</em> of their diet can be invaluable in lean years.
(Though Gnolls are meat-eaters, they have discovered a number of useful recipes involving grains that provide them at least some nourishment, which they can use to greatly stretch meat reserves.)</p>
<p>Though Gnolls may be somewhat rustic by Commonwealth standards, their communities nevertheless tend to be open and welcoming;
their ancestor's flight from persecution at the hands of their cousins, and their salvation at the hands of people strange and alien to them — Humans — is very much alive in Gnollish culture, and strongly informs their traditions and values to this day.</p>
<p>Gnolls put quite a lot of effort into getting along with members of other communities, and will go out of their way to make other races feel comfortable around them.
Many Gnollish communities have two separate set of customs, one for when members of other races are around, and one for when they're not.
For example, Gnolls are carrion-eaters, and many other races may be revolted by some of the things that Gnolls may eat; for this reason, Gnollish communities often have a recipe of &quot;guest-food,&quot; which both they and their guests can eat.
Gnolls are also aware of how savage and intimidating they can appear to be, so many of them put quite a lot of effort into developing refined personal styles: fine clothing, subtle jewelry, neat cuts of hair and mane, and died fur are all common.
Gnolls also commonly use veils to hide their predator's jaws from those who they do not with to frighten or intimidate.</p>
<p>Not every Commonwealth Gnoll stays in the small town where they are born.
Many Gnollish families have a long military tradition, and Gnolls make up almost two-thirds of the Commonwealth military's ranks.</p>
<p>Since the first Gnollish manors were settled besides Halfling neighbors, the two races have cooperated closely; Gnolls have long found employment with Halfling trade-caravans as guards.
To this day, many Halfling communities are located next to Gnollish ones, and clans of Halflings and Gnolls may have traditions of cooperation that go back centuries.
Gnolls that travel with Halfling caravans are often more urbane than their cousins; they are also more likely to go to great lengths to perfect a personal style that is just intimidating enough to scare off the wrong sort, without disturbing the paying customers as well!</p>
<p>There are also a number of Gnollish tribal communities in the territory to the west of the Worldspine Mountains.
Notably, much like their symbiosis with Humans and Halflings in the east, several Gnollish tribes allied with Herder communities in the west, where the frail Herders greatly valued them for their physical strength; this alliance became a force to be reckoned with in the west, and was the major opponent to the Shade Elves prior to the coming of the Commonwealth.</p>
<p>There is also a unique ethnic group of Gnolls hailing from stretch of snowy northland that lies to the east of the Worldspine mountains.
White-furred and adapted to the cold, these Gnolls have long lived on the snowy terrain above and around the subterranean holds of Dwarves, with whom they have long coexisted amicably; Snow Gnolls are expert hunters and herders, and they provide Dwarven holds with an invaluable source of meat.
Though few in numbers, the combination of these stealthy hunters scattered throughout the northern forests with the extreme resilience of Dwarven holds handily prevented the conquest of the North by the Empire of Man, and later by the Kingdoms of Men.</p>

Kingdom of Man roughly 200 years ago.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kobolds are sociable, creative, and very quick.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kobold culture is very family- and community-oriented</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Extended families tend to live together in large homes, and several
families will cluster together to form a block.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kobolds communities tend to have small personal spaces and large
public spaces; Kobolds tend to take enormous pride the quality of
their public spaces, which will commonly be excellently maintained,
and will feature impressive monuments or natural landscapes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kobolds have a short lifespan, but they also tend to have large
families; because of this, they have grown explosively</p>
<ul>
<li>even though they were absorbed only recently, many of the
largest Commonwealth city-states are underground Kobold
metropolises.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>They tend to live near Dwarves and Ash Elves, both of which are very
long-lived. This can create some complex relationships: it is not
uncommon for one Dwarf or Elf to closely befriend several
generations of one Kobold family in succession, watching each
generation come into adulthood, have children and pass away – an
arrangement that can be very bittersweet for the Dwarf or Ash Elf
involved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kobold culture strongly encourages industry, so Kobold communities
tend to be highly productive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They look like tiny, slender, bipedal dragons. Somewhat like Drakes, their
scales can take on a range of colors, and often metallic hues;
however, unlike Drakes, this rarely has any effect on the Kobold in
question.</p>
<ul>
<li>Like Drakes and Dragons, and unlike other reptiles, Kobolds are
warm-blooded.</li>
<li>Kobolds aren’t mammals; they don’t have mammary glands, and they
have internal genitalia. Because of this, Kobolds can have very
different ideas about what constitutes “appropriate attire”.</li>

<h3 id="shifters"><a class="header" href="#shifters">Shifters</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Shifters live in communities in the tribal territories; they are
rare elsewhere.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most shifter communities exist in tribal territories. Though most
Shifter communities signed the Commonwealth Charter long ago, in
practice, they have established few entanglements with outside
communities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Though not exactly insular, because they do not generally produce
goods for export, they are not generally able to import goods from
other communities, and so they tend to have little contact with
other races.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notably, Shifter communities tend to be very conservative. They are
wary of outsiders, and are happy to live their lives much as they
always have, and be left alone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Small numbers of Shifters filter out of the tribal communities,
seeking the exotic experiences the rest of the Commonwealth has to
offer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While there are a few Shifter manors, and some cities host notable
Shifter populations, Shifters who leave the tribal territories often
find themselves alone in their community, the only shifter in the
town or village where they settle. Because of this, shifters outside
the tribal territories tend to adopt the culture of the community
they settle in.</p>
<ul>
<li>Many shifters are not particularly social, so this often does
not bother them as much as it might bother members of other
species.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shifters often find work that suits their personal inclinations,
among the communities that they settle in; “their own inclination”
is often affected by the tendencies of their hybrid form.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Appearance: In humanoid form, shifters somewhat resemble elves and
humans. An individual shifter will often display traits appropriate
to their hybrid form.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="shifter-vitals"><a class="header" href="#shifter-vitals">Shifter Vitals</a></h4>

<li>
<p><em>Hybrid</em>: You have two forms: Humanoid and Hybrid.</p>
<ul>
<li>The specific details of each form are fixed.
That is, your Humanoid form, for example, looks the same every time you <em>shift</em> to it; you can't determine what it looks like each time you shift.
You can shift between forms at will; changing forms is a <em>Standard Action</em>.
<ul>
<li>In Humanoid form, you have a mixture of Human and (Wood) Elvish features.</li>
<li>In Hybrid from, you are roughly humanoid, but with the features of an animal.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When in <em>hybrid form</em>, you gain two of the following benefits (chosen when you create your character):
<ul>
<li>Claws: you have claws that do 2d10 DV, at -2 AP.</li>
<li>Teeth: You have a predator’s jaw, which allows you to bite foes.
The bite does 1d10+2 DV at -2 AP.
When you bite someone, if you score an Excellent Success, you may choose to <em>latch on</em>; this normally works like grappling the target.</li>
<li>Hearing: You have superb hearing, gaining +20 on auditory Perception checks.</li>
<li>Movement: you gain one of the following movement modes (in addition to your other movement modes):
<ul>
<li>Burrow 1/3</li>
<li>Climb 3/9</li>
<li>Flight 3/9/36</li>
<li>Glide 4/12/48</li>
<li>Hop 4/12</li>
<li>Swim 3/9</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Scent: you have a superb sense of smell; you gain the Scent sense.</li>
<li>Environment Adaptation: choose a hostile environment; you gain an adaptation that allows you to survive this environment.
For example, you might choose to survive in extreme cold, and thus gain a blubber layer.</li>
<li>Motion-Sensitivity: your vision becomes very sensitive to motion.
You gain +10 to Perception tests made against moving targets.</li>
<li>Sprinter: choose one movement mode and increase it by +1/+3 (for example, Walking 4/12 would become Walking 5/15).</li>
<li>Thick Hide: You gain +1 armor.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Fast-Healing</em>: you have Fast Healing 1</p>
</li>

<h4 id="optional-trait-animal-form"><a class="header" href="#optional-trait-animal-form">Optional Trait: Animal Form.</a></h4>
<p>Some shifters, in addition to their <em>hybrid</em> form, can entirely assume the form of an animal.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Effect</strong>: you can assume the form of an animal.
<ul>
<li>Your animal form resembles a normal member of the animal that your hybrid form was based on.</li>
<li>Your animal form can’t be too large (as large as an elephant, larger than size Large) or too small (as small as a cricket, smaller than size Small).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
