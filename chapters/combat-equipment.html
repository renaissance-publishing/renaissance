                        <h1 id="combat-items"><a class="header" href="#combat-items">Combat Items</a></h1>
<p>In general, we try to keep items and inventories fairly abstract; we break items into five broad cost-categories, and most things are purchased as part of a skill kit.
However, we do have a wide variety of listed combat items, with a diverse list of tags; this is because such items are often central to combat characters, and their players frequently enjoy getting to add detail to their characters.</p>
<h2 id="armors"><a class="header" href="#armors">Armors</a></h2>
<p>The following listings are for common types of armor.
Each entry is for a full <em>suit</em> or <em>set</em> of the given armor type (that is, helmets, gauntlets and grieves are not purchased separately).
(The list also contains some related garments that provide AV or other useful features.)</p>
<p>Armor is often heavy and cumbersome, and it is not normally possible to wear more than one suit of armor at a time.
<strong>Layerable</strong> armors are an exception: they can be worn under (or sometimes over) other armors to provide an additional benefit.
Besides your primary armor, you can wear a second set of armor under or over it, but only if the second set has the layerable tag.</p>
<p>Most people only wear armor if they are either going into battle or are performing some ceremonial role; wearing armor while eating, attending a reception, doing business, or otherwise going about your business would be considered extremely unusual at best (which might impose penalties to social skills checks, and would make it nearly impossible to blend into a crowd), and might be interpreted as a threat at worst.
<strong>Sociable</strong> armors are an exception; either because they are accepted as normal attire in some cultures, or because they are not obvious as armor, they can be worn in social situations without seeming strange.
(The <strong>Sociable</strong> tag is potentially dependant on the culture and situation; in some situations, the GM may declare that it does not apply.)</p>
<p>Some armors provide protection at the cost of impairing movement, whether by virtue of being heavy, or rigid, or awkwardly placed; these armors have the <strong>Cumbersome</strong> tag.
(The exact penalty or penalties will be listed separately.)</p>
<p>Most armors are assumed to represent a complete suit of armor of a consistent construction — for example, a whole suit of plate, including helmets, gauntlets and grieves, or an entire coat of mail, covering a user to the thigh and including sleeves.
Some armor, however, consist of different components, such as pairing plate at the arms and legs with a brigandine chest-piece.
These armors have the <strong>Composite</strong> tag.</p>
<p>Most armors cover most of the wearer’s body, including their head and extremities.
Some armor, however, leaves large portions of the wearer exposed; these armors have the <strong>Exposed</strong> tag.
Armors with the <em>exposed</em> tag are particularly vulnerable to those attempting to <em>strike an armor gap</em> (see the maneuver, in <em>Combat</em>), and may impose other penalties as well (listed separately.)</p>
<p>Some armor (and other outfits) are particularly good at concealing their wearer.
Armor with the <strong>Stealthy</strong> tag provides the wearer with a +10 bonus to Stealth checks.</p>
<p>Similarly, some armors (and other garments) obscure the wearer, making it difficult to identify them.
Armor with the <strong>Concealing</strong> tag provides the wearer with a +10 bonus when attempting to blend into a crowd.
They also make it impossible to detect items concealed with Slight of Hand, and impose a -30 penalty on Read checks made against the wearer.
(These bonuses only apply to casual inspection — such as passing a character in a crowd.
They do not apply to detailed inspection — such as if a character is being searched.)</p>
<p>Some armor is especially visible, ostentatious, or prominent; this is often true of armors that have a ritual or ceremonial role, armors that prominently bear the insignia of some clan or organization, or armors that are commonly worn during competition.
These armors have the <strong>Proud</strong> tag.
Armor with the <em>Proud</em> tag can provide bonuses or penalties in social situations, depending on the associations that other characters have with the armor or its insignia; this is at the GM's discretion.
In combat, opponents may view a character wearing <em>Proud</em> armor as particularly prominent or threatening, and thus be more likely to focus on that character.</p>

<p><em>Brigandine armor is representative of a wide variety of &quot;intermediate&quot; armors based on the composition of many smaller plates with other materials, like layers of mail, leather, or plate.</em>
<em>This entry can be adapted to produce lamellar armor, laminar armors, a coat-of-plates, or other broadly similar armors.</em></p>
<p>Brigandine armor is one among several varieties of armors that make use of <em>metal plates</em> to improve protection.
Brigandine armor consists of small, oblong metal plates riveted to the outside of a leather garment.
Brigandine armor provides improved protection over mail, while being cheap and easy to produce — although it still requires access to good-quality steel plates, and the highest-quality armors still require those plates to be fitted to the wearer.</p>
<p>Brigandine armor is in wide use in the Commonwealth.
It became the standard armor for the Commonwealth's armies more than 180 years ago; only within the last 30 years as the Commonwealth begun to replace brigandine armor with solid plate even for its common soldiery.</p>

<em>It is similar to Brigandine, but is easier to manufacture — especially if you're scavenging components.</em>
<em>It is commonly worn by Shade Elven raiders.</em></p>
<p>Raider's armor is a style of armor commonly worn by Shade Elves.
It has replaced iron mail jackets and coats as the Shade Elves' enemies have begun to use more powerful and effective weapons.</p>
<p>Raider's armor is, of course, designed for use by a mounted archer; it is built in the style of a heavy jacket, typically running down to the knee and covering the wearer's thighs, but split so that the wearer can ride a horse.
Raider's armor is multi-layered; it consists of metal plates, riveted to an outer layer of leather and covered on the inside by a layer of fabric.
(Silk is often used, as it's believed to better bind arrows as they strike, making them easier to remove.)
This armor allows the Shade Elves to make use of metal plates for armor, while still remaining relatively light, flexible, and easy to manufacture and wear.</p>
<p>The components can vary; the Shade Elves have poor access to steel, so the inner plates are often made of iron, cured leather, or even wood.
Shade Elves also often scrap captured Commonwealth steel armors to make Raider's armor; Commonwealth plates are often fitted to Gnollish or Drake wearers, which Shade Elves cannot conceivably wear, so these larger plates are cut into smaller pieces for use in raider's armor.
(One notable benefit of riveting the plates on the <em>inside</em> is that an attacker does not necessarily know how many plates are present, what their extent is, or what they are made of.)</p>

<h3 id="imperial-armor"><a class="header" href="#imperial-armor">Imperial Armor</a></h3>
<p><em>Imperial Armor is an example variant armor, based on Brigandine armor.</em>
<em>It requires more maintenance and is more difficult to make, but it provides good protection, and it travels better because it can be broken into segments which collapse on themselves.</em>
<em>It is commonly worn by the soldiers of the Goblin Empire.</em></p>
<p>Imperial Armor is a distinctive style of armor worn by the soldiers of the Goblin Empire.
As much as an improvement in technology, it represents the rapid increase in wealth in the Goblin Empire and the strides the Empire has made in consolidating power under their banner.</p>
<p>The Second High Kingship of the Kingdom of Men took a toll on the Goblins; for centuries after, high-quality metal armors became a scarcity, as the relatively poor and unorganized Goblin Kingdoms outfitted their various troops with a range of armors, often of hide or light mail.
As the Goblin Empire has grown wealthy from the conquest of the Ruby Plane, metal armors have become more common — and as the Empire has slowly shifted power from the Goblin Kings and Warlords to its own bureaucracy, it has increasingly standardized the equipment and training of its troops.</p>
<p>Imperial armor is made out of a series of horizontal steel bands, overlapping at the bottom; these are attached to vertical strips of leather.
(These strap are thick, which lifts the steel plates slightly off the chest and back of the wearer; this is important to keep the plates from catching on the plates of the goblin's own bony segmented plates.)
The shoulders feature their own, larger plates, &quot;sleeves&quot; of smaller plates protect the arms (and, rarely, thighs).</p>
<p>The design of this armor allows the Empire to field steel plate armors, without requiring that a single solid plate be individually fitted to its wearer.
The armor also travels well, because it can be &quot;collapsed&quot;—where the plates stack over the top of each other.
The rows of plates typically do not meet along the sides under the arms, so it is also light and breaths relatively well — especially since Imperial troops usually do not wear layers of leather or cloth beneath it as the soldiers of the Kingdoms or Commonwealth do.</p>
<p>On the down-side, this armor also doesn't completely cover the wearer: it doesn't cover the legs or under-arms, and leaves plenty of prominent gaps.
This problem is mitigated in practice, because Imperial troops are normally issued large, curved shields, and they rely on these shields (and close formation) to provide primary defense.</p>

<p>A punch or buckler is a small metal disc or cone held wielded over the knuckles and hand of the users off-hand;

They are useful for the mix of mobility and cover that they provide; they are often used to block incoming arrows and crossbow bolts, allowing heavily-armored combatants to close effectively.</p>

<p>Some armies deploy these shields in formation, where they can be powerful defensive weapons;
tower shields in the front ranks can cover pikeman in rear ranks, creating a powerful formation — if one that is vulnerable to being flanked.
Many Dwarven holds use tower shields in the defense of their holds; there, they allow them to nearly completely block off the narrow hallways and irregular stone tunnels of their homes.
Some Gnollish families in Northland Province have also developed a fighting style that centers on the use of a tower shield; the style is notably different from the one used by their Dwarven neighbors, and focuses on maximizing the defense provided by the shield in melee combat.</p>

<h2 id="weapons"><a class="header" href="#weapons">Weapons</a></h2>
<p>The following is a sampling of the weapons in use throughout the world.
It is by no means complete; GMs and players should feel free to create
whatever specific weapons they desire by starting with a similar weapon
from the list and making changes as necessary.</p>
<p>Some weapons can be used <strong>One-Handed</strong>, while others require a
<strong>Two-Handed</strong> grip; still others are worn rather than held (and this
have the <strong>No-Handed</strong> tag).</p>
<p>Some weapons are particularly good at parrying, guarding or deflecting
attacks; these weapons have the <strong>Defensive</strong> tag. When you use such a
weapon to defend yourself, you gain a +10 bonus. Conversely, some
weapons may be awkward, clumsy or fragile — or, in the case of ranged
weapons, may not be designed to <em>strike</em> an opponent at all — and thus it
is very awkward to defend yourself while carrying them; these weapons
have the <strong>Vulnerable</strong> tag. You take a -10 penalty to your defense when
wielding such a weapon.</p>
<p>Similar to Vulnerability, some weapons, though they may be effective,
hinder your ability to move about; these weapons have the <strong>Awkward</strong>
tag. Awkward weapons impose a -10 penalty to <em>movement skills</em> while you
are wielding them.</p>
<p>Some weapons, commonly pole-arms, have a particularly long reach, which
provides a notable advantage; these weapons have the <strong>Reach</strong> tag.
Reach weapons can attack an opponent who is 1m further away (that is, if
you are using a combat grid with 1m sqaures, then you can attack people
who are 1 square away). Reach weapons also do not suffer a penalty for
attacking a mounted character.</p>
<p>Some weapons are particularly good at preventing an opponent from
closing; these weapons have the <strong>Fend</strong> tag. If you have such a weapon
and an opponent comes within reach of you, you can make an <em>attack of
opportunity</em> against them (normally, you could only make an attack of
opportunity if they attempted to move away from or past you.) This uses
all the normal rules for an attack-of-opportunity, including counting as
a reaction.</p>
<p>Some weapons can be braced, and used to receive a charge; these weapons
have the <strong>Brace</strong> tag. See <em>Charging</em> in <em>Combat</em> for the rules for
bracing to receive a charge.</p>
<p>Some weapons are particularly easy to use; these weapons have the
<strong>Easy</strong> tag. Such weapons receive a +10 bonus on attack checks.
Conversely, some weapons are very <em>difficult</em> to use; they have the
<strong>Difficult</strong> tag, and receive a -10 penalty on attack checks.</p>
<p>Some weapons are well-suited to a particular combat maneuver; these
weapons have the <strong>Well-Suited</strong> tag. The Well-Suited tag will always
include the specific maneuver that a weapon is used with, written as
“Well-Suited: Trip”. When using a well-suited weapon, you do not take
the listed penalty when attempting the given maneuver.</p>
<p>Many weapons are particularly difficult to use in confined spaces, where
drawing and swinging a weapon is difficult. Some weapons, however, can
be used effectively even when you have very little room to maneuver.
Weapons with the <strong>Close</strong> tag can be used in confined spaces without
penalty.</p>
<p>Weapons with the <strong>Small</strong> tag can also be used in confined spaces by
virtue of their size; however, they have other drawbacks, including
their lack of reach compared to other weapons (which imposes a -10
penalty to your attack and defense when fighting a character with a
reach advantage).</p>
<p>Most weapons are awkward (at best) to use while mounted; some, however,
make excellent mounted weapons. These weapons have the <strong>cavalry</strong> tag;
see <em>Mounted Combat</em> in <em>Combat</em> for details.</p>
<p>Some weapons are particularly able to bypass a defender’s guard; these
weapons have the <strong>Bypass</strong> tag, and impose a -20 penalty to the
defender’s defense.</p>
<p>This is the point where I ran out of energy. The ones that are left are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prone: this weapon can be used just as effectively while prone.</li>
<li>Loud: this weapon is very loud; it will be obvious to anyone in the
area when it is used.</li>
<li>Single-Use: some weapons are designed to be used only once; after a
single shot (if a ranged weapon) or single hit (if a melee weapon),
the weapon becomes useless.</li>
<li>Soak: this weapon is particularly well-suited to delivering poisons.</li>
<li>Grip: this weapon improves grip while grappling. (Doesn’t this only
possibly apply to the wraps?)</li>
<li>Secure: this weapon is very difficult to disarm.</li>
<li>… actually, it’s true in general that not every tag has to have a
rule. Hmm.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of these should really be rewritten to just punt to the rules in
Combat. This includes at least Reach and Brace.</p>
<h2 id="no-handed-weapons"><a class="header" href="#no-handed-weapons">No-Handed Weapons</a></h2>
<p>No-handed weapons are typically <em>worn</em>, like clawed or spiked gauntlets.
Though they put a wielder at a disadvantage against someone with a
longer weapon (which will give their opponent and advantage in reach and
leverage), they do have the certain advantages — including that some of
them are not obvious as weapons.</p>
<h3 id="hand-wraps"><a class="header" href="#hand-wraps">Hand Wraps</a></h3>

<p>One-handed weapons are simple to drill with, and allow a deal of

to carry a shield, a second weapon, or activate devices like Torches or
levers. A single hand on the weapon means the wielder will lack the
leverage and raw power of a two-handed weapon, though certain one-handed
weapons can match the reach of polearms, or be thrown as ranged weapons.</p>
<h3 id="knife"><a class="header" href="#knife">Knife</a></h3>
<p>Knives are small, concealable weapons that come in a great variety of
designs and styles; the example here is a short blade with a single

primarily for use as weapons; they are commonly carried as utility items
by woodsman and craftsmen. Knives are commonly used by assassins and
criminals, so many knives feature channels on the blade that can hold
poisons, or hollowed handles that can be used to hold small items or
messages.</p>

Short swords are a classic military sidearm used by countless cultures throughout the Emerald Plane.
Though they are heavier, more difficult to wield and more expensive than other weapons of comparable length, they are also more versatile; they can be used to thrust and parry as well as slash, and so they can be used in tight quarters, can be used defensively and can be used to make very precise attacks.</p>
<p>Arming swords are a ubiquitous sidearm wielded by Commonwealth troops; they have a single edge, which comes to a sharpened point at the end; they are suitable for slashing and thrusting, and thanks in part to being single-edged they are cheap to produce in large numbers, even when manufactured at the high levels of quality for which the Commonwealth is known.</p>

<h3 id="war-axe"><a class="header" href="#war-axe">War Axe</a></h3>
<p>A war axe is any axe of up to 60cm, with either a single or double head.
War axes are common weapons found throughout the cultures of the Emerald
Plane; most consist of a long, wooden heft with a single metal blade at
the end. They are common because they are easy and cheap to make,
because they are effective even when made with poor metal, and because
they require little training for a user to be minimally effective.
Because much of their length is wooden, axes are lighter and faster than
swords — though they also offer more force behind a blow, because they are
heavily weighted towards the head. For the same reason, they are
slightly more capable of defeating armor, thanks to focusing a greater
force on a smaller point of impact.</p>
<p>Goblins make particularly common use of war axes, owing to their lack of
access to high-quality steel. In recent years, some Goblin smiths have
begun to attach a hook, hammer-point or spike to the back of the weapon,
intended for use against armored targets.</p>

<p>A longbow is a bow that is 180cm in length or more. Longbows require

conflict with the Shaded Sea Peoples — despite the Herder’s relative lack

large nuts) up to blistering speeds. Though often considered a child's
toy or a tool for hunting vermin, they can still be lethal in the right
hands.</p>
<p>Caravan-going Halflings make frequent use of these weapons, owing to
their small size, cheap and easy construction, ease of provision (as
they don’t require specialized ammunition), and easy concealment.</p>

<h3 id="special-arrows"><a class="header" href="#special-arrows">Special Arrows</a></h3>
<p>The following <em>special arrows</em> can be used with composite bows and longbows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Diamond</strong>: <em>Diamond</em> arrows are named for the cross-section of the arrowhead, not the material they're made of (they're just wood, with a steel arrowhead).  Diamond arrows are particularly good at penetrating armor.  Diamond arrows have +2 AP and gain the <em>Piercing</em> tag.  Diamond arrows are Cost: Minor for 6 arrows.</li>
<li><strong>Improvised</strong>: <em>improvised</em> arrows are hastily constructed; they might not be properly fletched, and they might not even have a metal tip.  They do -1 DV and have -1 AP; if they aren't even properly fletched, they impose a -10 penalty to the attack check.  Improvised Arrows are Cost: Minor for 12 arrows.</li>
<li><strong>Broadhead</strong>: <em>broadhead</em> arrows have large heads that trail <em>edges</em> that can be sharpened.  Broadheads are particularly good at wounding flesh, and often cause bleeding.  Broadhead arrows do +1 DV, and cause <em>Bleeding 1</em> on an exceptional or critical success.  On the down-side, their large heads are somewhat more expensive.  Broadhead arrows are Cost: Minor for 4 arrows.</li>
<li><strong>Needle</strong>: <em>needle</em> arrows have an extremely narrow circular cross-section, like a needle.  They are cheap to make, they are good at penetrating armor, and they fly further (owing to the lower drag).  On the down-side, though, they are easy to deflect if they do not strike head-on.  Needle arrows are AP 3, have the <em>Piercing</em> tag, and gain +25m to each range increment.  If the attacker only scores a normal success, their DV is halved.  Needle arrows are Cost: Minor for 8.</li>
<li><strong>Blunts</strong>: <em>blunt</em> arrows are designed to <em>stun</em> a target, rather than kill it.  Rather than being sharpened to a point, blunt arrows are… blunted.  Some are even covered with hide, wadding, or another soft material.  (Of course, users should be aware that any time you're causing trauma to a target, serious injury and death are always possibilities.)  Blunt arrows halve the DV they do and are AP 0.  Blunt arrows are Cost: Minor for 6.</li>
<li><strong>Rush</strong>: the heads of <em>rush</em> arrows are magical; they induce air to flow quickly over their thin blades or wings.  If an arrow where to be activated and held, this would produce a steady, strong breeze; when activated in flight, this propels the arrow powerfully forward.  (This effect only lasts for a few seconds — long enough to be useful when fired at a target)  This allows these arrows to travel great distances and strike with extreme force; the fragility of the magical arrowhead somewhat limits their damage and armor-penetration, but the great speed at impact largely makes up for this.  Rush arrows add +10m/+25m/+40m/+50m to each range bracket, +2 DV, but -1 AP (that is, they are worse at penetrating armor).  One Rush arrow is Cost: Minor.</li>
</ul>
<p>As always, this list is not exhaustive; players and GMs should feel free to add more as desired.</p>
<div class="asside">
<p><em>Improvised arrows</em> are listed even though we don't track &quot;normal&quot; ammo consumption, because you never know when you'll have your arrows stolen, or when the GM will declare that, over the course of the last month of travel, you've definitely run out of arrows.</p>
</div>
<div class="asside">
<p>As-written, these arrows can't be used with crossbows, because we assume that that crossbow bolts have very different <em>terminal ballistics</em> that impose tighter constraints on how their bolt-heads can be designed and how differently they can perform.
Basically, they travel faster and strike harder, so the heads probably have to be designed more similarly to punch through armor.</p>
<p>Of course, &quot;we&quot; (meaning the lead author) could <em>very easily</em> be wrong about this — or this might just be boring — so GMs and players should feel free to disregard this restriction.</p>

<p><em>This weapon is an example variant weapon; it is based on the dagger. These weapons are difficult to use, but they are larger than normal daggers and more difficult to disarm.</em></p>
<p>Shade elves use these unusual weapons with an energetic and mobile
fighting style; practitioners dart forward and back quickly, making
vicious thrusts on forward lunges and parrying and guarding when they
dart back.</p>

<h3 id="flail"><a class="header" href="#flail">Flail</a></h3>
<p>Military flails are one of several martial weapons derived from
agricultural tools; agricultural flails are used in threshing. Military
flails are two-handed weapons consisting of a long wooden shaft, to
which a heavy wooden or metal striking head is attached by a hinge
(which is normally little more than two interlocked metal loops); some
also feature short lengths of metal change to attach the head. Because
they are heavy and are not rigid, military flails can be awkward to
handle and swing, and some of the force of a blow is wasted; however,
they can be useful because the hinged head allows them to potentially
strike around a guard or shield.</p>

<h3 id="war-fork"><a class="header" href="#war-fork">War-Fork</a></h3>
<p>The war-fork is an example variant weapon. “Knives” are a very diverse
class of weapons, of which the war-fork is a member. War-forks loose the
utility and soak tags, and gain the Difficult tag; in exchange, though,
they gain the Catch and Well Suited: Catch and Disarm tags. Because they
have both the Catch and Well Suited: Catch tags, they are incredibly
good at trapping enemy weapons!</p>
<p>Developed from an agricultural tool used in handling bails of grain,
war-forks are small, one-handed weapons consisting of a central
long-and-narrow blade, coupled with two smaller blades or tines mounted
on either side. The the central blade is usually sharpened along its
length, it is primarily useful for thrusting attacks. The unusual weapon
is somewhat difficult to use, but it is very versatile, and in
particular allows for a number of defensive techniques, including
parrying and blade-catching. These weapons are also very light, and are
often used in pairs.</p>

<h3 id="hand-cannon"><a class="header" href="#hand-cannon">Hand Cannon</a></h3>
<p>There have been sporadic attempts to miniaturize cannons for use by
single infantry for more than 100 years, but only within the last 65
have workable hand-cannons begun to appear. Hand-cannons, as the name
implies, are much like miniature cannons; they consist of a barrel, a
chamber with a hole tapped into it, and a socket to which a longer
wooden grip is attached. The cannon is loaded by packing powder and a
projectile down the barrel, and fired by holding a lit object up to the
touch hole. Though a wide variety of projectiles can be used with
hand-cannons — among them arrows and rocks — metal balls manufactured
specifically for the purpose have become common.</p>
<p>Hand-cannons are heavy and awkward; while it is possible to hold it with
one hand and touch off the weapon with the other, it is difficult to do.
In practice, the weapons are often used by a pair of soldiers: one who
holds and aims the weapon while the other touches it off.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth are the heaviest users of these weapons, with the Goblin Empire being a close second.</p>
<p>Much like crossbows, it takes time to reload a hand-cannon; for this reason, it is not uncommon to discard the hand-cannon after it has been fired, and the weapon is only retrieved and reloaded after combat.
This is especially likely to be the case if the weapon is not being carried by a team.</p>
<p>The projectiles fired by hand-cannons fly extremely rapidly, and are incredibly <em>hard to dodge</em> (this means that fray checks are divided by 2; see the <em>Guns</em> alternate rule).</p>

<p><strong>Special:</strong> If you have a partner helping you operate the weapon, then it looses the Difficult tag (as it is easy for you to aim, and easy for them to fire).  Working with a partner, you can also reload a hand-cannon with only two Standard Actions.</p>
<h3 id="whip"><a class="header" href="#whip">Whip</a></h3>
<p>Whips are common tools for managing livestock and work-animals;
they consist of long, slender pieces of tanned leather.
Though they are very painful, they are not nearly as dangerous as purpose-built weapons, they are all but useless against even the slightest armor, and cannot be used to parry or defend against a close attacker.
Nevertheless, some do use them for self-defense, as a less-lethal weapon, to disarm opponents or to move small objects at range.</p>

<h3 id="dragons-axe"><a class="header" href="#dragons-axe">Dragon’s Axe</a></h3>
<p><em>The Dragon’s Axe is an example unique weapon. As the description says, the Dragon’s Axe allows the wielder access to at least one powerful, armor-defeating shot, without leaving them defenseless in melee combat. Such a weapon might have an unreliable firing mechanism, or it might have a weaker shaft (owing to it being hollow to double as a barrel)—or it also might not! The weapon might be perfectly servicable as both an axe and matchlock. The choice is up to the player and the GM, and depends on what the CP cost of the weapon is, and what kind of “feel” the GM wants for the setting, and the player wants for their character.</em></p>
<p>A unique weapon built to order at great expense to the Dragonshire noble
that commissioned it, it was designed to make the might of gunpowder
available to its wielder without leaving them vulnerable in
close-combat. The axe’s shaft is reinforced, and also serves as the
barrel of a projectile weapon; the handle has a sophisticated,
matchlock-like mechanism to trigger the weapon.</p>
