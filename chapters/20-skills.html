<h2 id="types-of-skill"><a class="header" href="#types-of-skill">Types of Skill</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Many skills describe a unique task, like Riding or Stealth, describe
some discrete skill that you either have some degree of experience
in or you do not.</p>
<ul>
<li>For these skills, you simply purchase ranks for them (or get
them from your background, or possibly from some other source).</li>
<li>Your target number is then your ranks in the skill, plus your
score in the linked aptitude, plus any modifiers that apply (as
in the Tests section).</li>
<li>Stealth and Perception are examples of these kinds of skills.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sometimes, a task can be broken into fields. The process of
mastering one field is similar to the process of mastering another,
but the specific things that you learn to do are different.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, blacksmiths and cobblers have two very different
skill-sets, but both are <em>professions</em>.</li>
<li>In these cases, we use <em>field skills</em>.</li>
<li>You can’t take ranks in a field skill directly; rather, you have
to also pick a <em>field</em>. The combination of the field skill and a
specific field produces a single skill. For example, you can’t
take ranks in <em>Art</em>, but you can take ranks in <em>Art: Sculpture</em>.</li>
<li>You can take the same field skill more than once, as long as you
pick a different field each time. For example, you can take
ranks in <em>Art: Painting</em> and <em>Art: Sculpture</em>, and you would
treat the two as two entirely separate skills in every way.</li>
<li>Each field skill will include a list of sample fields. You don’t
have to pick one of the samples, but if you don’t, you should
get your GM’s permission. You should also make sure that you and
your GM both agree on when your field skill applies and when it
doesn’t. And, obviously, your field shouldn’t be much broader or
much narrower than the samples are.</li>
<li>You can specialize in a field skill the same way you could a
normal skill. For example, you could have the <em>Art: Painting
[Landscapes]</em> skill.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sometimes, the same set of skills can apply to several different
sup-disciplines, with only slight modifications; an athlete might be
able to learn a new sport fairly easily, for example, or an
experienced sword-fighter might be able to use a mace ably without
ever having trained with it before.</p>
<ul>
<li>In these cases, we use <em>Proficiency Skills</em>.</li>
<li>Each proficiency skill that you have ranks in will have an
associated list of <em>proficiencies</em>.</li>
<li>When you use a proficiency skill, see if you have a proficiency
appropriate to the task: if you do, roll the proficiency skill
as normal; if you don’t, roll your proficiency skill at a -20
penalty.</li>
<li>For example, suppose you have 40 ranks in the Athletics skill,
and have proficiencies in Acrobatics, Climbing and Freerunning.
If you want to vault over a low fence and roll to keep your
momentum, then you would roll you full Athletics skill as
normal, since your proficiency in Freerunning applies. However,
if you need to swim across a swiftly-flowing river, you would
take a -20 penalty, because you don’t have the Swimming
proficiency.</li>
<li>Somewhat like field skills, each proficiency skill will list
sample proficiencies. When you select a proficiency, you don’t
have to pick one of the samples, but you should get your GM’s
permission to use one that you make up yourself.</li>
<li>You can specialize in a Proficiency Skill; normally, you would
do this by picking a particular proficiency to specialize in.</li>
<li>Sometimes, no proficiency is required; in these cases, simply
roll the check as normal, with no penalty.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>See <em>character creation</em> for rules on acquiring ranks in skills,
specializations, and proficiencies.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="skill-list"><a class="header" href="#skill-list">Skill List</a></h2>
<div class="asside">
<div class="asside-title">Crunchy, But Not Mechanical</div>
<p>A good description of Renaissance, provided by an early playtester, is that it is &quot;crunchy but not mechanical&quot;--meaning that it provides players with clear, mathematical rules for manipulating checks, but few descriptive rules for how those checks should be used (what might be called &quot;mechanics&quot; or &quot;systems&quot;).</p>
<p>The skill descriptions that follow are an example of this principle;
We describe the kinds of things that are common areas of expertise; later, in <em>Character Creation</em>, we'll tell you how to purchase ranks in these skills — which will allow you great control over what exactly your target number will be when you are required to roll a skill check.
But we <em>don't</em> tell you <em>exactly</em> what each skill can be used to do, or <em>exactly</em> what kind of modifiers you're likely to encounter;
that's largely up to the GM and the players.</p>
<p>This is the reverse of some other RPGs, which might tell you specifically what each skill can be used to do, and what checks would be required;
this difference might require some getting used to!</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Animal Handling (SAV)</p>
<ul>
<li>Active, Social</li>
<li>Animal Handling is used as the “Social Skill for Animals”. It’s used to coax animals into doing what you would like them to do (to scare them of, for example), or to change their attitude towards you (to earn their trust, for example).</li>
<li>Animal Handling can be used to train an animal, but we don’t provide detailed rules for that. This is generally best handled either by purchasing a Class or Power (like Wildlander), or by purchasing the animal companion as a Moderate or Major Item and then building it using the rules for Followers.</li>
<li>Sample Specialization: by a family of animals (canines, felines, equines, etc.), or by role (combat, work, companion, riding)</li>
<li>Aryn wants to <strong>scare off a mountain lion</strong> that's threatening the group; she rolls her <em>Animal Handling</em>, versus the mountain lion's Resist Social Manipulation.</li>
<li>The mountain lion has been shadowing the group, so Aryn decides to try to lure it to her and <strong>befriend it</strong>; she rolls her <em>Animal Handling</em> again, this time unopposed.</li>
<li>Aryn decides to <strong>train</strong> the mountain lion <strong>as a companion</strong>; mountain lions can't normally be domesticated, so this is going to be tricky; the GM decides that this is a 30-shift Job, requiring an Animal Handling test with a -10 penalty.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Art (INT, Field Skill)</p>
<ul>
<li>Active, Knowledge</li>
<li>Sample Fields: Literature, Painting, Sculpture, Theater</li>
<li>Specializations: by field</li>
<li>River is pretending to be a minstrel, so he decides to spend some time <strong>playing his flute in a bar</strong> for money; this requires an <em>Art: Music</em> check.</li>
<li>The adventure taps out River's finances, so he finds himself in the embarrassing situation of needing money: he makes a bargain with a tavern owner, a day spent playing for a day's lodging.  This doesn't require a check an <em>Art: Music</em> check, since he doesn't need to play particularly stirringly to satisfy the tavern owner; it might require a Protocol check to talk the bartender into accepting the deal, or a Profession: Minstrel check to determine just how much River makes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Athletics (SOM, Proficiency Skill)</p>
<ul>
<li>Active, Movement, Physical</li>
<li>Represents your characters’ general athletic ability, and the specific list of athletic disciplines that you’re proficient with.</li>
<li>Example Proficiencies:
<ul>
<li><strong>Agility</strong> is used for forms of athleticism that rely on dexterity, grace and precision.  For humanoids, this covers flips, rolls, dives, and the like.  <em>Agility</em> is used for most <em>stunt moves</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Endurance</strong> is used for forms of athleticism that rely on perseverance.  For humanoids, this covers jogging, distance running, swimming, and the like.</li>
<li><strong>Might</strong> is used when strength is the primary factor.  For humanoids, this covers throwing, pulling, lifting, long jumps, and the like.</li>
<li><strong>Swiftness</strong>, which is used for raw speed.  <em>Swiftness</em> is usually used in chases (whether you're tring to <em>catch</em> someone or <em>outrun</em> them).</li>
<li>of by <em>Specific Sports</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Aryn is <strong>chasing a suspect</strong> through the streets of Tern City; this requires opposed Athletics checks, both using the <em>Swiftness</em> proficiency.  They both have the <em>Swiftness</em> proficiency, so they both roll their Athletics skill (assuming they're both running flat-out); if Aryn wins, she'll gain on him, but if he wins, he'll open the distance.</li>
<li>The suspect decides to try to trip Aryn up, so he knocks over a table behind him.  Aryn wants to <strong>vault the table</strong>, so the GM calls for an <em>Athletics</em> check using the <em>Agility</em> proficiency.  Aryn has the <em>Agility</em> proficiency, so she rolls her Athletics without penalty; if she makes it, she'll vault the table.</li>
<li>The suspect wants to <strong>climb the wooden facade of a building</strong>.  The GM decides this requires the <strong>Might</strong> proficiency, but the suspect doesn't have it, so he rolls his <em>Athletics</em> with a -20 penalty.  If he fails, he will fall.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Control (WIL)</p>

<ul>
<li>Active, Social</li>
<li>Used to deceive people in social situations — to make other
characters believe what you want them to believe.</li>
<li>Can also be used (usually in conjunction with Disguise) to hide
your identity, and possibly to impersonate someone else.
(Obviously, impersonating a specific person will be very tricky,
and might not be possible at all if you don’t have information
about that person to go on, or are forced to interact with
people who know that person well.)</li>
<li>For minor or simple lies, can be used unopposed.</li>
<li>For big lies, important scenes or major characters, your
Deception is opposed by either the target’s Read or their Resist
Social Manipulation.</li>
<li>Obviously, most people will not believe absurd or outlandish
lies, regardless of how skillful a liar a character is.</li>

</li>
<li>

<li>Can be used to blend in to a crowd, in which case it’s usually used unopposed.</li>
<li>If you are trying to follow someone without being noticed, then it is opposed by that person’s Perception.</li>

<h2 id="unusual-skills"><a class="header" href="#unusual-skills">Unusual Skills</a></h2>
<p>Sometimes you’ll want your character to be able to do something that isn’t exactly covered by a skill, like analyzing a crime scene, tracking game through the woods, or picking a lock.
One option, certainly, is to take an Exotic Skill; for example, Exotic Skill: Lock-Picking.
However, while that might be very descriptive, it's also very narrow in use: lock-picking is a much more narrowly-defined skill than, for example, <em>persuasion</em>, and you could easily go several games without it coming up.</p>
<p>A better option might be to take an existing skill, and apply a descriptive specialization – for example, Craft: Clockwork [Lockpicking].
This makes it clear to the GM how you'd like to use the skill, while allowing you to invest in a more generally-useful skill.</p>
<p>The Knowledge and Profession skills can also be used to establish a specific special skill-set for a character — for example, Profession: Hunter.</p>
<p>Of course, whether you purchase ranks in an Exotic Skill or use a specialization to &quot;flavor&quot; an existing skill, you should talk with your GM about it.
In particular, make sure that the GM understands and agrees with how you want the skill to work mechanically – what you want it to represent, when you want to be able to use it, what modifiers the check will have, and so on.</p>
<p>Likewise, if you’re unsure about a skill selection, you should discuss it with the GM; make sure that the GM understands not only what you want the skill to represent, but what you want to be able to <em>do</em> with it, and be sure that you and the GM agree with not only what the skill is supposed to represent, but what it’s supposed to do and how it’s supposed to work.</p>
<h2 id="gotchas-and-confusing-cases"><a class="header" href="#gotchas-and-confusing-cases">Gotchas and Confusing Cases</a></h2>
<p>While developing the game, we've run into a few &quot;gotchas&quot; and confusing cases:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Disguise</strong> only covers the <em>physical</em> half of pretending to be someone else; for the social half — that is, to talk to people without being discovered — you’ll also need <em>Deception</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Search</strong> is used to actively search an area for something; it takes time, and you move around.
<strong>Perception</strong> is used for noticing things quickly — seeing things when you enter a room, as opposed to after looking around.
Search is also used to track someone or something.</li>
<li><strong>Control</strong> is used to manage your own magical energies, and to develop sleights.
It does <em>not</em> represent a characters &quot;will power,&quot; that’s the <strong>WIL</strong> attribute.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="removed-skills"><a class="header" href="#removed-skills">Removed Skills</a></h2>
<p>We also have a few notes about candidate skills that we've removed:</p>
<p>We initially included an <strong>Investigate</strong> skill, but we found it too narrowly applicable, and too unclear about what it did.
Wouldn't you use <em>Search</em> to find clues?
Wouldn't you use <em>Profession: Detective</em> for professional skills and knoweldge about solving crimes?
Was it just for solving mysteries – was &quot;Deduction&quot; really something we needed a skill for?
We decided to remove it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Replacement:
<ul>
<li>Normally, you'd use <em>Search</em> to search a crime scene for clues, and you'd use a <em>Solve a Logic Puzzle</em> check (COG × 3) to reason through a crime.</li>
<li>Profession: Detective or Profession: Investigator could also be used to represent the kinds of common knowledge (about criminals, crime-solving, investigation, and deduction) that <em>Investigator</em> characters would usually have.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>As an Exotic Skill:
<ul>
<li>Exotic Skill: Investigation (COG or INT; Active, Mental, Technical)</li>
<li>Exotic Skill: Deduction (COG; Active, Mental)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Several other fantasy games have a <strong>Disable Device</strong> skill, so we included it in several of our early skill lists.
However, since classical &quot;dungeon-delves&quot; aren't a core scenario for us, we found that it was not very useful – in fact, after a year of development and testing, it'd never come up!</p>
<ul>
<li>Replacement:
<ul>
<li>Disabling fine mechanical devices would normally be covered by the same skill used to create them – Craft: Clockwork.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>As an Exotic Skill:
<ul>
<li>Exotic Skill: Lock-Picking (COG or INT; Active Physical, Technical) </li>
<li>Exotic Craft: Trap-Making (COG; Active Physical, Technical)</li>
<li>Exotic Skill: Disable Device (COO or COG; Active, Physical, Technical)</li>
</ul>
</li>
