<p>Here we list a number of <em>items</em> that your character may have.
Some of these items are common, like tool kits or work animals; others are rare or unique.
This list is <em>by no means</em> exhaustive; GMs and players may of course find countless other diverse items for sale in the Commonwealth's shops, carried by travelers from the Kingdoms of Men or littered on the shores of distant islands.</p>
<p>Note that we also list <em>services</em> here, since <em>services</em> are acquired using the same rules (and fall into the same cost categories, see below).</p>
<p>Items are broken into five categories, called <em>cost categories</em>: <em>trivial, minor, moderate, major,</em> and <em>extreme</em>; these categories are described in their own sections below.
This determines their cost both at character creation (see <em>Character Creation</em>) and when purchased using the rules for purchasing items (see <em>Wealth, Income and Lifestyles</em>).
These categories represent each item's cost, but they also correspond loosely with how <em>important</em> we expect each item to be in defining a given character; &quot;how important is this purchase&quot; is a useful guideline for GMs assigning costs to items that are not listed.</p>
<div class="asside">
<div class="asside-title">Why Not Specific Prices</div>
<p>Why do we use cost-categories instead of specific prices?</p>
<p>For three reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>one, because it actually is <em>realistic</em>: before central banks and stable currencies, bartering (without fixed prices) was common;</li>
<li>two, because it saves people having to do &quot;cash-register math,&quot; which is never an exciting step in an adventure; and</li>
<li>three, because it allows us to skip boring and tedious details — because, for characters with very high levels of wealth, the <em>exact</em> cost of a night at an inn is an unimportant detail (see also the rules for bartering in <em>Wealth, Income and Lifestyles</em>).</li>
</ul>
<p>We recommend that you don't worry about the difference between the price of a <em>tent</em> and the price of a <em>meal</em>.
In principle, that difference is well below the &quot;threshold of importance and interest&quot; that we choose to care about in this game — and just as importantly, since an ideal &quot;adventuring party&quot; will include at least one &quot;provisioner&quot; character, that difference should also be unimportant in practice.
(See also <em>Wealth, Income and Lifestyles</em>.)</p>
</div>
<p>The mages and artisans of the Commonwealth have a serviceable command of
magic; while magical items tend to be rarer and more expensive than
non-magical ones, a number of common magical items (and potions) are
widely available throughout the Commonwealth.</p>
<p>Some items have <em>tags</em>.
Many of these tags do not have &quot;mechanical&quot; affects themselves — although traits, classes, powers, and other rules may refer to them.
(The special abilities of weapons are something of an exception: combat in general has more specific rules than the rest of the game, and so the items commonly used in combat have more specific rules as well.)</p>
<p>Several of these items are heavy or cumbersome.
Rather than attempting to track item weight in detail, items that are particularly heavy are given the <em>Heavy</em> tag.
To determine how many <em>Heavy</em> items a character can carry without penalty, divide their STR by 5.
For every additional <em>Heavy</em> item beyond this number, the character suffers a -10 penalty to all physical actions.
(Of course, GMs can apply other appropriate penalties as well; a character cannot choose to carry 500 suits of plate armor in exchange for a -495 penalty to physical checks — which would then be limited to the maximum penalty of -60.)</p>
<h2 id="common-items-by-category"><a class="header" href="#common-items-by-category">Common Items by Category</a></h2>
<h3 id="trivial-items"><a class="header" href="#trivial-items">Trivial Items</a></h3>
<p>A <em>trivial</em> item is an item of no notable cost, like a fork or a candle.
Usually, you shouldn't purchase a trivial item on its own; you should usually purchase a skill kit rather than purchasing a bunch of <em>trivial</em> items separately (since trivial items are often the kinds of things that are included in skill kits).
(See <em>Wealth, Income and Lifestyles</em>.)</p>
<p>The following are examples of <em>Trivial</em> items:</p>
<ul>
<li>a meal</li>
<li>a candle</li>
<li>a fork</li>
<li>a weak magical potion</li>
<li>a simple magical item</li>
<li>(the services of) a local messenger</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="minor-items"><a class="header" href="#minor-items">Minor Items</a></h3>
<p>A <em>minor</em> item is an item of little cost — worth tracking, but only if you have limited funds.</p>
<p>Most minor items are intended to be <em>single, useful items</em> — things that are worth keeping track of, but that aren't very important to how your character is defined.</p>
<p>Like trivial items, it is often a better idea to purchase a skill kit than to purchase a minor item separately: a tent, knapsack and bedroll could be presumed to be included in a <em>Survival</em> Skill Kit, for example.</p>
<p>The following are examples of <em>minor</em> items:</p>
<ul>
<li>a tent</li>
<li>a knapsack</li>
<li>a bedroll</li>
<li>a ladder</li>
<li>a lantern</li>
<li>a pet (a bird, a cat, a dog, a rat)</li>
<li>a common magical potion or item</li>
<li>a night in an inn</li>
<li>rations for 7 days (see <em>Travel</em>)</li>
<li>an outfit (may be more or less expensive based on style and quality)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="moderate-items"><a class="header" href="#moderate-items">Moderate Items</a></h3>
<p>A <em>moderate</em> item has notable cost: though they're within the means of an average family, they will be very expensive, having a notable impact on their finances.</p>
<p>Most minor items <em>are</em> intended to be <em>significant</em> to your character concept; their signature weapons, their distinctive armor and the tools with which they practice their trade all show up at this tier.</p>
<p>The following are examples of <em>moderate</em> items:</p>
<ul>
<li>a rowboat</li>
<li>a weapon</li>
<li>a suit of armor</li>
<li>a shield</li>
<li>a skill kit</li>
<li>a work animal (like a guard dog or ox), farm animal (sheep or cattle), or mount (a horse or cave salamander)</li>
<li>three day’s convalescence</li>
<li>(the services of) a priest</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="major-items"><a class="header" href="#major-items">Major Items</a></h3>
<p>A <em>major</em> item is expensive; entirely beyond the reach of the poor, and of notable expense even to the wealthy.</p>
<p>Most <em>major</em> items play a major roll in defining a character — maybe as important as a power, since they have the same price (see <em>Character Creation</em>.
They might include a distinctive heirloom weapon, a unique magical item, the shop where they run their business, or their estate.</p>
<p>Example <em>major</em> items include:</p>
<ul>
<li>a shop</li>
<li>a home</li>
<li>a powerful or unique magical item (see below)</li>
<li>one month’s work by an artisan</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="extreme-items"><a class="header" href="#extreme-items">Extreme Items</a></h3>
<p><em>Extreme</em> items are of extraordinary worth — only available to the most wealthy, they represent fortunes, treasures and power-bases.</p>
<p>Most <em>extreme</em> items are intended to play a major role in how you define your character, possibly opening whole new options up to them; a caravel is among the newest, largest and most capable types of ocean-going vessels, for example, and having one might open up whole new avenues to a player.</p>
<ul>
<li>a seaworthy ship (like a Caravel)</li>
<li>an estate</li>
<li>land-holdings</li>
<li>a prosperous trading business</li>
</ul>
<div class="asside">
<div class="asside-title">Designing Major and Extreme Items</div>
<p>We claim that you can purchase unique magical items and priceless, character-shaping treasures, but we don't give you an actual <em>list</em>, and we don't give you rules for making them.
So, where are these alleged treasures supposed to come from?</p>
<p>Simply put, players and characters make them themselves.</p>
<p>Designing <em>major</em> and <em>extreme</em> items is a collaborative process between players and GMs.
A player who has a magic item in mind describes it to the GM, and then the GM and player work collaboratively to build a description and rules for it.</p>
<p>There are a few examples throughout this section, but we will provide you with some guidelines below (these guidelines are most applicable to magical weapons).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Items should have clear rules.</strong>  You don't have to specify everything exhaustively, but you should make sure that the GM understands what the player <em>definitely can do</em> (and <em>wants to do</em>) with their item, and you should make sure that the player understands what they <em>definitely can't do</em> (and what the GM considers out-of-bounds).  You should also look out for any &quot;special cases&quot; and what-ifs that you'll need to cover.</li>
<li><strong>Items shouldn't eclipse other options.</strong>  An item you're paying 10 CP for should probably be better than an item you're playing 5 CP for, but an item should generally never completely outstrip some other character design.  Major things to look out for are that an item should never completely remove the need for a specific character archetype, should never grant the same ability as a power-but-better, and should never replace the need for a skill.
<ul>
<li>This is why you shouldn't add a &quot;hard invisibility&quot; cloak, for example.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Items shouldn't open certain Pandora's Boxes.</strong>  There are some items you just shouldn't introduce into the game — even though people are going to ask.
<ul>
<li>Items that add &quot;flat&quot; aptitude bonuses or &quot;flat&quot; damage boosts are a bad idea.  The former is at once too powerful (because it effects too many skills too cheaply) and not as useful as it seems (because of how the D100 system works), and the latter is unbalancable unless you start giving enemies ever-increasing DUR (which forces every other character to play the same damage-stacking game).</li>
<li>Items that give you extra actions or turns in combat are a very bad idea.</li>
<li>&quot;Impulse&quot; healing potions are a bad idea too.  Healing is supposed to be difficult, and making it too easy short-circuits some deliberate game-design choices.  (If you find yourself in frequent need of an impulse-healing item, consider running your game in a system that's designed to focus on combat-heavy adventures.)</li>
</ul>

<div class="asside">
<div class="asside-title">Mundane Items</div>
<p>We've got lists of weapons, armors, and drugs; why isn't there a list of mundane items, like tents and saddles?</p>
<p>The short and direct answer is that most of those should be handled by purchasing an appropriate <em>skill kit</em> (see below).
If you're purchasing a lot of <em>saddles</em>, <em>ladders</em> and <em>tents</em>, then you should probably just purchase one or two skill kits to cover the job you're trying to gear up for.</p>
</div>
<div class="asside">
<div class="asside-title">Why isn't there an item list?</div>
<p>So, why are we leaving all this design work up to players (and GMs)?</p>
<p>One reason is just that <em>it's a lot of damned work!</em>
We're a small team, and creating a large list of diverse, high-quality items would be quite an undertaking!</p>
<p>But there are other reasons too — and our laziness isn't even the most important one!</p>
<p>We also don't believe that it's possible to create a list of magical items that is <em>exhaustive</em> (in the sense that it covers most of the magical items that people would want) without being <em>unwieldy</em> (in the sense that it would be far to vast to be useful).
Any <em>very large</em> list of magical items will encumber <em>all</em> players with a huge list of items that they have to navigate, hoping that the item they want is in there <em>somewhere</em>.
If it is, then they're at least in luck; if it <em>isn't</em>, then they're tasked with designing their item anyway!
(Albeit, we concede, with dozens of existing items in useful guidance.)</p>
<p>There's the additional problem of <em>balancing</em> all those items.
Most very large lists of magical items will frequently be narrowed down to a few very powerful items (that are considered <em>essential</em>) and a large number of weaker items (that are never used).
Designing a list of dozens of magical items such that no one of them is notably stronger or weaker than any of the others is a practical impossibility.</p>
<p>Both of these concerns apply even more to a system for <em>designing</em> magical weapons.
Given such a system, anyone who wants a magical weapon now has to fight through all those rules;
if those rules are flexible enough that they could produce any reasonable magical item, they'll almost certainly be so huge that trying to use them will be a major undertaking;
and designing those rules such that every item it produces is balanced against all the others is a practical impossibility.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="armors"><a class="header" href="#armors">Armors</a></h2>
<p>The following listings are for common types of armor.
Each entry is for a full <em>suit</em> or <em>set</em> of the given armor type (that is, helmets, gauntlets and grieves are not purchased separately).
(The list also contains some related garments that provide AV or other useful features.)</p>
<p>Armor is often heavy and cumbersome, and it is not normally possible to wear more than one suit of armor at a time.
<strong>Layerable</strong> armors are an exception: they can be worn under (or sometimes over) other armors to provide an additional benefit.
Besides your primary armor, you can wear a second set of armor under or over it, but only if the second set has the layerable tag.</p>
<p>Most people only wear armor if they are either going into battle or are performing some ceremonial role; wearing armor while eating, attending a reception, doing business, or otherwise going about your business would be considered extremely unusual at best (which might impose penalties to social skills checks, and would make it nearly impossible to blend into a crowd), and might be interpreted as a threat at worst.
<strong>Sociable</strong> armors are an exception; either because they are accepted as normal attire in some cultures, or because they are not obvious as armor, they can be worn in social situations without seeming strange.
(The <strong>Sociable</strong> tag is potentially dependant on the culture and situation; in some situations, the GM may declare that it does not apply.)</p>
<p>Some armors provide protection at the cost of impairing movement, whether by virtue of being heavy, or rigid, or awkwardly placed; these armors have the <strong>Cumbersome</strong> tag.
(The exact penalty or penalties will be listed separately.)</p>
<p>Most armors are assumed to represent a complete suit of armor of a consistent construction — for example, a whole suit of plate, including helmets, gauntlets and grieves, or an entire coat of mail, covering a user to the thigh and including sleeves.
Some armor, however, consist of different components, such as pairing plate at the arms and legs with a brigandine chest-piece.
These armors have the <strong>Composite</strong> tag.</p>
<p>Most armors cover most of the wearer’s body, including their head and extremities.
Some armor, however, leaves large portions of the wearer exposed; these armors have the <strong>Exposed</strong> tag.
Armors with the <em>exposed</em> tag are particularly vulnerable to those attempting to <em>strike an armor gap</em> (see the maneuver, in <em>Combat</em>), and may impose other penalties as well (listed separately.)</p>
<p>Some armor (and other outfits) are particularly good at concealing their wearer.
Armor with the <strong>Stealthy</strong> tag provides the wearer with a +10 bonus to Stealth checks.</p>
<p>Similarly, some armors (and other garments) obscure the wearer, making it difficult to identify them.
Armor with the <strong>Concealing</strong> tag provides the wearer with a +10 bonus when attempting to blend into a crowd.
They also make it impossible to detect items concealed with Slight of Hand, and impose a -30 penalty on Read checks made against the wearer.
(These bonuses only apply to casual inspection — such as passing a character in a crowd.
They do not apply to detailed inspection — such as if a character is being searched.)</p>
<p>Some armor is especially visible, ostentatious, or prominent; this is often true of armors that have a ritual or ceremonial role, armors that prominently bear the insignia of some clan or organization, or armors that are commonly worn during competition.
These armors have the <strong>Proud</strong> tag.
Armor with the <em>Proud</em> tag can provide bonuses or penalties in social situations, depending on the associations that other characters have with the armor or its insignia; this is at the GM's discretion.
In combat, opponents may view a character wearing <em>Proud</em> armor as particularly prominent or threatening, and thus be more likely to focus on that character.</p>

<p>A doublet or jacket consisting of layering material around thick wadding

<p>A flexible covering of metal made of interlocking rings, mail armor has been in use in one form or another for more than 800 years.
Mail is relatively quick to weave and manufacture from the proper wire stock, so it is effective at stretching limited supplies of metal.
It's flexibility makes it easy to wear, and it means that it can be made large enough to cover most of the wearer's body without limiting mobility or requiring careful fitting and manufacture; however, mail hangs very heavily from the wearer, which impedes useful mobility in its own way.
Mail is also relatively bad at distributing impacts, and resisting modern arrowheads and lances; for this reason, those who can afford to do so are shifting to plated armors.</p>

<p><em>Brigandine armor is representative of a wide variety of &quot;intermediate&quot; armors based on the composition of many smaller plates with other materials, like layers of mail, leather, or plate.</em>
<em>This entry can be adapted to produce lamellar armor, laminar armors, a coat-of-plates, or other broadly similar armors.</em></p>
<p>Brigandine armor is one among several varieties of armors that make use of <em>metal plates</em> to improve protection.
Brigandine armor consists of small, oblong metal plates riveted to the outside of a leather garment.
Brigandine armor provides improved protection over mail, while being cheap and easy to produce — although it still requires access to good-quality steel plates, and the highest-quality armors still require those plates to be fitted to the wearer.</p>
<p>Brigandine armor is in wide use in the Commonwealth.
It became the standard armor for the Commonwealth's armies more than 180 years ago; only within the last 30 years as the Commonwealth begun to replace brigandine armor with solid plate even for its common soldiery.</p>

<h3 id="raiders-armor"><a class="header" href="#raiders-armor">Raider's Armor</a></h3>
<p><em>Raider's armor is an example variant armor, based on Brigandine armor.</em>
<em>It is similar to Brigandine, but is easier to manufacture — especially if you're scavenging components.</em>
<em>It is commonly worn by Shade Elven raiders.</em></p>
<p>Raider's armor is a style of armor commonly worn by Shade Elves.
It has replaced iron mail jackets and coats as the Shade Elves' enemies have begun to use more powerful and effective weapons.</p>
<p>Raider's armor is, of course, designed for use by a mounted archer; it is built in the style of a heavy jacket, typically running down to the knee and covering the wearer's thighs, but split so that the wearer can ride a horse.
Raider's armor is multi-layered; it consists of metal plates, riveted to an outer layer of leather and covered on the inside by a layer of fabric.
(Silk is often used, as it's believed to better bind arrows as they strike, making them easier to remove.)
This armor allows the Shade Elves to make use of metal plates for armor, while still remaining relatively light, flexible, and easy to manufacture and wear.</p>
<p>The components can vary; the Shade Elves have poor access to steel, so the inner plates are often made of iron, cured leather, or even wood.
Shade Elves also often scrap captured Commonwealth steel armors to make Raider's armor; Commonwealth plates are often fitted to Gnollish or Drake wearers, which Shade Elves cannot conceivably wear, so these larger plates are cut into smaller pieces for use in raider's armor.
(One notable benefit of riveting the plates on the <em>inside</em> is that an attacker does not necessarily know how many plates are present, what their extent is, or what they are made of.)</p>

<h3 id="imperial-armor"><a class="header" href="#imperial-armor">Imperial Armor</a></h3>
<p><em>Imperial Armor is an example variant armor, based on Brigandine armor.</em>
<em>It requires more maintenance and is more difficult to make, but it provides good protection, and it travels better because it can be broken into segments which collapse on themselves.</em>
<em>It is commonly worn by the soldiers of the Goblin Empire.</em></p>
<p>Imperial Armor is a distinctive style of armor worn by the soldiers of the Goblin Empire.
As much as an improvement in technology, it represents the rapid increase in wealth in the Goblin Empire and the strides the Empire has made in consolidating power under their banner.</p>
<p>The Second High Kingship of the Kingdom of Men took a toll on the Goblins; for centuries after, high-quality metal armors became a scarcity, as the relatively poor and unorganized Goblin Kingdoms outfitted their various troops with a range of armors, often of hide or light mail.
As the Goblin Empire has grown wealthy from the conquest of the Ruby Plane, metal armors have become more common — and as the Empire has slowly shifted power from the Goblin Kings and Warlords to its own bureaucracy, it has increasingly standardized the equipment and training of its troops.</p>
<p>Imperial armor is made out of a series of horizontal steel bands, overlapping at the bottom; these are attached to vertical strips of leather.
(These strap are thick, which lifts the steel plates slightly off the chest and back of the wearer; this is important to keep the plates from catching on the plates of the goblin's own bony segmented plates.)
The shoulders feature their own, larger plates, &quot;sleeves&quot; of smaller plates protect the arms (and, rarely, thighs).</p>
<p>The design of this armor allows the Empire to field steel plate armors, without requiring that a single solid plate be individually fitted to its wearer.
The armor also travels well, because it can be &quot;collapsed&quot;—where the plates stack over the top of each other.
The rows of plates typically do not meet along the sides under the arms, so it is also light and breaths relatively well — especially since Imperial troops usually do not wear layers of leather or cloth beneath it as the soldiers of the Kingdoms or Commonwealth do.</p>
<p>On the down-side, this armor also doesn't completely cover the wearer: it doesn't cover the legs or under-arms, and leaves plenty of prominent gaps.
This problem is mitigated in practice, because Imperial troops are normally issued large, curved shields, and they rely on these shields (and close formation) to provide primary defense.</p>

Coating the wearer's body in solid plates of refined steel, it is worn by the noble knights of the Dragonshire and Kingdoms of Men, and by the Commonwealth’s fearsome elite soldiers and shock troops.
Full plate can vary somewhat in quality and fitting; while the plates can be heavy, well-fitted armors little impairs gross agility or strength.</p>

<h3 id="buckler"><a class="header" href="#buckler">Buckler</a></h3>
<p>A punch or buckler is a small metal disc or cone held wielded over the knuckles and hand of the users off-hand;
it is usually held with a horizontal bar passing directly behind the center of the shield.
The buckler provides little cover to the user, but does benefit those who rely on parrying to deflect incoming attacks.</p>

<h3 id="swordbreaker"><a class="header" href="#swordbreaker">Swordbreaker</a></h3>
<p>A swordbreaker is a dagger or short-sword intended primarily for defensive use.
Though they don't have much of an edge, the back of the blade features a ``comb'' of raised and lowered points.
A tool of the dishonorable, it is used by swordsmen to trap and hold their opponent's sword, leaving them open to attack.</p>

<h3 id="targe"><a class="header" href="#targe">Targe</a></h3>
<p>A <em>targe</em> is a round, wooden shield with a metal boss in the centre and a metal rim;
they are often painted in prominent colours and patterns.

<h3 id="kite-shield"><a class="header" href="#kite-shield">Kite shield</a></h3>
<p>Kite shields are made entirely of metal, and are commonly wielded by elite fighters in cultures capable of producing high-quality steel at scale — and thus they are commonly seen wielded by knights.
Kite shields cover a wielder from shoulder to thigh, and are usually about as wide as the wielder's chest.
They are useful for the mix of mobility and cover that they provide; they are often used to block incoming arrows and crossbow bolts, allowing heavily-armored combatants to close effectively.</p>
<p>Heater shields are similar in function, though they are wider and not quite as tall;
heater shields are in ubiquitous use in both the Kingdoms of Men and the Commonwealth's military.</p>

<h3 id="tower-shield"><a class="header" href="#tower-shield">Tower Shield</a></h3>
<p>Tower shields are enormous, covering the user from head to knee.
The largest shields in common use by single fighters, tower shields also provide cover for the ranks behind them, as well as an impassible wall to opponents in front.</p>
<p>Some armies deploy these shields in formation, where they can be powerful defensive weapons;
tower shields in the front ranks can cover pikeman in rear ranks, creating a powerful formation — if one that is vulnerable to being flanked.
Many Dwarven holds use tower shields in the defense of their holds; there, they allow them to nearly completely block off the narrow hallways and irregular stone tunnels of their homes.
Some Gnollish families in Northland Province have also developed a fighting style that centers on the use of a tower shield; the style is notably different from the one used by their Dwarven neighbors, and focuses on maximizing the defense provided by the shield in melee combat.</p>

<h2 id="weapons"><a class="header" href="#weapons">Weapons</a></h2>
<p>The following is a sampling of the weapons in use throughout the world.
It is by no means complete; GMs and players should feel free to create
whatever specific weapons they desire by starting with a similar weapon
from the list and making changes as necessary.</p>
<p>Some weapons can be used <strong>One-Handed</strong>, while others require a
<strong>Two-Handed</strong> grip; still others are worn rather than held (and this
have the <strong>No-Handed</strong> tag).</p>
<p>Some weapons are particularly good at parrying, guarding or deflecting
attacks; these weapons have the <strong>Defensive</strong> tag. When you use such a
weapon to defend yourself, you gain a +10 bonus. Conversely, some
weapons may be awkward, clumsy or fragile — or, in the case of ranged
weapons, may not be designed to <em>strike</em> an opponent at all — and thus it
is very awkward to defend yourself while carrying them; these weapons
have the <strong>Vulnerable</strong> tag. You take a -10 penalty to your defense when
wielding such a weapon.</p>
<p>Similar to Vulnerability, some weapons, though they may be effective,
hinder your ability to move about; these weapons have the <strong>Awkward</strong>
tag. Awkward weapons impose a -10 penalty to <em>movement skills</em> while you
are wielding them.</p>
<p>Some weapons, commonly pole-arms, have a particularly long reach, which
provides a notable advantage; these weapons have the <strong>Reach</strong> tag.
Reach weapons can attack an opponent who is 1m further away (that is, if
you are using a combat grid with 1m sqaures, then you can attack people
who are 1 square away). Reach weapons also do not suffer a penalty for
attacking a mounted character.</p>
<p>Some weapons are particularly good at preventing an opponent from
closing; these weapons have the <strong>Fend</strong> tag. If you have such a weapon
and an opponent comes within reach of you, you can make an <em>attack of
opportunity</em> against them (normally, you could only make an attack of
opportunity if they attempted to move away from or past you.) This uses
all the normal rules for an attack-of-opportunity, including counting as
a reaction.</p>
<p>Some weapons can be braced, and used to receive a charge; these weapons
have the <strong>Brace</strong> tag. See <em>Charging</em> in <em>Combat</em> for the rules for
bracing to receive a charge.</p>
<p>Some weapons are particularly easy to use; these weapons have the
<strong>Easy</strong> tag. Such weapons receive a +10 bonus on attack checks.
Conversely, some weapons are very <em>difficult</em> to use; they have the
<strong>Difficult</strong> tag, and receive a -10 penalty on attack checks.</p>
<p>Some weapons are well-suited to a particular combat maneuver; these
weapons have the <strong>Well-Suited</strong> tag. The Well-Suited tag will always
include the specific maneuver that a weapon is used with, written as
“Well-Suited: Trip”. When using a well-suited weapon, you do not take
the listed penalty when attempting the given maneuver.</p>
<p>Many weapons are particularly difficult to use in confined spaces, where
drawing and swinging a weapon is difficult. Some weapons, however, can
be used effectively even when you have very little room to maneuver.
Weapons with the <strong>Close</strong> tag can be used in confined spaces without
penalty.</p>
<p>Weapons with the <strong>Small</strong> tag can also be used in confined spaces by
virtue of their size; however, they have other drawbacks, including
their lack of reach compared to other weapons (which imposes a -10
penalty to your attack and defense when fighting a character with a
reach advantage).</p>
<p>Most weapons are awkward (at best) to use while mounted; some, however,
make excellent mounted weapons. These weapons have the <strong>cavalry</strong> tag;
see <em>Mounted Combat</em> in <em>Combat</em> for details.</p>
<p>Some weapons are particularly able to bypass a defender’s guard; these
weapons have the <strong>Bypass</strong> tag, and impose a -20 penalty to the
defender’s defense.</p>
<p>This is the point where I ran out of energy. The ones that are left are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prone: this weapon can be used just as effectively while prone.</li>
<li>Loud: this weapon is very loud; it will be obvious to anyone in the
area when it is used.</li>
<li>Single-Use: some weapons are designed to be used only once; after a
single shot (if a ranged weapon) or single hit (if a melee weapon),
the weapon becomes useless.</li>
<li>Soak: this weapon is particularly well-suited to delivering poisons.</li>
<li>Grip: this weapon improves grip while grappling. (Doesn’t this only
possibly apply to the wraps?)</li>
<li>Secure: this weapon is very difficult to disarm.</li>
<li>… actually, it’s true in general that not every tag has to have a
rule. Hmm.</li>
</ul>

<p>No-handed weapons are typically <em>worn</em>, like clawed or spiked gauntlets.
Though they put a wielder at a disadvantage against someone with a
longer weapon (which will give their opponent and advantage in reach and
leverage), they do have the certain advantages — including that some of
them are not obvious as weapons.</p>

<p>One-handed weapons are simple to drill with, and allow a deal of

to carry a shield, a second weapon, or activate devices like Torches or

criminals, so many knives feature channels on the blade that can hold
poisons, or hollowed handles that can be used to hold small items or

<p>A short sword is any sword of up to 75cm in length, with a short handle

countless cultures throughout the Emerald Plane. Though they are
heavier, more difficult to wield and more expensive than other weapons
of comparable length, they are also more versatile; they can be used to
thrust and parry as well as slash, and so they can be used in tight
quarters, can be used defensively and can be used to make very precise
attacks.</p>
<p>Arming swords are a ubiquitous sidearm wielded by Commonwealth troops;
they have a single edge, which comes to a sharpened point at the end;
they are suitable for slashing and thrusting, and thanks in part to
being single-edged they are cheap to produce in large numbers, even when
manufactured at the high levels of quality for which the Commonwealth is
known.</p>

<h3 id="war-axe"><a class="header" href="#war-axe">War Axe</a></h3>
<p>A war axe is any axe of up to 60cm, with either a single or double head.
War axes are common weapons found throughout the cultures of the Emerald
Plane; most consist of a long, wooden heft with a single metal blade at
the end. They are common because they are easy and cheap to make,
because they are effective even when made with poor metal, and because
they require little training for a user to be minimally effective.
Because much of their length is wooden, axes are lighter and faster than
swords — though they also offer more force behind a blow, because they are
heavily weighted towards the head. For the same reason, they are
slightly more capable of defeating armor, thanks to focusing a greater
force on a smaller point of impact.</p>
<p>Goblins make particularly common use of war axes, owing to their lack of
access to high-quality steel. In recent years, some Goblin smiths have
begun to attach a hook, hammer-point or spike to the back of the weapon,
intended for use against armored targets.</p>

<p>A longbow is a bow that is 180cm in length or more. Longbows require
incredible strength to draw, and so their wielders are often some of the
largest and strongest soldiers on the battlefield. Longbows are also
very difficult to use; proficiency with the longbow almost requires the
wielder to be raised to it, and so only cultures that have a “culture of
the bow” can boast many longbowmen.</p>
<p>The Herders have such a “culture of the bow,” and Herder longbowmen have
long provided the Commonwealth with a powerful advantage in their
conflict with the Shaded Sea Peoples — despite the Herder’s relative lack
of brute strength. This era may be coming to a close, however, as
crossbows replace longbows even in Herders’ hands.</p>
<p>Some Goblin Warlords have also cultivated a mastery of the longbow; the
Goblin longbowmen so produced are coveted assets, whom Goblin kings
competed over and who the Goblin Empire now pays handsomely for.</p>
<p>Humans have both the strength and dexterity to make excellent
longbowmen; some kingdoms within the Kingdoms of Men practice the
longbow, and have produced some of the most proficient longbowmen that
the Emerald Plane has seen. However, these longbowmen are often drawn
from the peasant classes, and are often deployed without proper training
or equipment; this hinders their effectiveness.</p>

<p>Light crossbows are particularly common in both the Commonwealth and the

human-manufactured heavy crossbows have become a terrifying force on the

<p>A leather strap with a small pouch at the middle, slings use centrifugal

<h3 id="special-arrows"><a class="header" href="#special-arrows">Special Arrows</a></h3>
<p>The following <em>special arrows</em> can be used with composite bows and longbows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Diamond</strong>: <em>Diamond</em> arrows are named for the cross-section of the arrowhead, not the material they're made of (they're just wood, with a steel arrowhead).  Diamond arrows are particularly good at penetrating armor.  Diamond arrows have +2 AP and gain the <em>Piercing</em> tag.  Diamond arrows are Cost: Minor for 6 arrows.</li>
<li><strong>Improvised</strong>: <em>improvised</em> arrows are hastily constructed; they might not be properly fletched, and they might not even have a metal tip.  They do -1 DV and have -1 AP; if they aren't even properly fletched, they impose a -10 penalty to the attack check.  Improvised Arrows are Cost: Minor for 12 arrows.</li>
<li><strong>Broadhead</strong>: <em>broadhead</em> arrows have large heads that trail <em>edges</em> that can be sharpened.  Broadheads are particularly good at wounding flesh, and often cause bleeding.  Broadhead arrows do +1 DV, and cause <em>Bleeding 1</em> on an exceptional or critical success.  On the down-side, their large heads are somewhat more expensive.  Broadhead arrows are Cost: Minor for 4 arrows.</li>
<li><strong>Needle</strong>: <em>needle</em> arrows have an extremely narrow circular cross-section, like a needle.  They are cheap to make, they are good at penetrating armor, and they fly further (owing to the lower drag).  On the down-side, though, they are easy to deflect if they do not strike head-on.  Needle arrows are AP 3, have the <em>Piercing</em> tag, and gain +25m to each range increment.  If the attacker only scores a normal success, their DV is halved.  Needle arrows are Cost: Minor for 8.</li>
<li><strong>Blunts</strong>: <em>blunt</em> arrows are designed to <em>stun</em> a target, rather than kill it.  Rather than being sharpened to a point, blunt arrows are… blunted.  Some are even covered with hide, wadding, or another soft material.  (Of course, users should be aware that any time you're causing trauma to a target, serious injury and death are always possibilities.)  Blunt arrows halve the DV they do and are AP 0.  Blunt arrows are Cost: Minor for 6.</li>
<li><strong>Rush</strong>: the heads of <em>rush</em> arrows are magical; they induce air to flow quickly over their thin blades or wings.  If an arrow where to be activated and held, this would produce a steady, strong breeze; when activated in flight, this propels the arrow powerfully forward.  (This effect only lasts for a few seconds — long enough to be useful when fired at a target)  This allows these arrows to travel great distances and strike with extreme force; the fragility of the magical arrowhead somewhat limits their damage and armor-penetration, but the great speed at impact largely makes up for this.  Rush arrows add +10m/+25m/+40m/+50m to each range bracket, +2 DV, but -1 AP (that is, they are worse at penetrating armor).  One Rush arrow is Cost: Minor.</li>
</ul>
<p>As always, this list is not exhaustive; players and GMs should feel free to add more as desired.</p>
<div class="asside">
<p><em>Improvised arrows</em> are listed even though we don't track &quot;normal&quot; ammo consumption, because you never know when you'll have your arrows stolen, or when the GM will declare that, over the course of the last month of travel, you've definitely run out of arrows.</p>
</div>
<div class="asside">
<p>As-written, these arrows can't be used with crossbows, because we assume that that crossbow bolts have very different <em>terminal ballistics</em> that impose tighter constraints on how their bolt-heads can be designed and how differently they can perform.
Basically, they travel faster and strike harder, so the heads probably have to be designed more similarly to punch through armor.</p>
<p>Of course, &quot;we&quot; (meaning the lead author) could <em>very easily</em> be wrong about this — or this might just be boring — so GMs and players should feel free to disregard this restriction.</p>

<p>Military flails are one of several martial weapons derived from
agricultural tools; agricultural flails are used in threshing. Military
flails are two-handed weapons consisting of a long wooden shaft, to
which a heavy wooden or metal striking head is attached by a hinge
(which is normally little more than two interlocked metal loops); some
also feature short lengths of metal change to attach the head. Because
they are heavy and are not rigid, military flails can be awkward to
handle and swing, and some of the force of a blow is wasted; however,
they can be useful because the hinged head allows them to potentially
strike around a guard or shield.</p>

<h3 id="war-fork"><a class="header" href="#war-fork">War-Fork</a></h3>
<p>The war-fork is an example variant weapon. “Knives” are a very diverse
class of weapons, of which the war-fork is a member. War-forks loose the
utility and soak tags, and gain the Difficult tag; in exchange, though,
they gain the Catch and Well Suited: Catch and Disarm tags. Because they
have both the Catch and Well Suited: Catch tags, they are incredibly
good at trapping enemy weapons!</p>
<p>Developed from an agricultural tool used in handling bails of grain,
war-forks are small, one-handed weapons consisting of a central
long-and-narrow blade, coupled with two smaller blades or tines mounted
on either side. The the central blade is usually sharpened along its
length, it is primarily useful for thrusting attacks. The unusual weapon
is somewhat difficult to use, but it is very versatile, and in
particular allows for a number of defensive techniques, including
parrying and blade-catching. These weapons are also very light, and are
often used in pairs.</p>

<h3 id="hand-cannon"><a class="header" href="#hand-cannon">Hand Cannon</a></h3>
<p>There have been sporadic attempts to miniaturize cannons for use by
single infantry for more than 100 years, but only within the last 65
have workable hand-cannons begun to appear. Hand-cannons, as the name
implies, are much like miniature cannons; they consist of a barrel, a
chamber with a hole tapped into it, and a socket to which a longer
wooden grip is attached. The cannon is loaded by packing powder and a
projectile down the barrel, and fired by holding a lit object up to the
touch hole. Though a wide variety of projectiles can be used with
hand-cannons — among them arrows and rocks — metal balls manufactured
specifically for the purpose have become common.</p>
<p>Hand-cannons are heavy and awkward; while it is possible to hold it with
one hand and touch off the weapon with the other, it is difficult to do.
In practice, the weapons are often used by a pair of soldiers: one who
holds and aims the weapon while the other touches it off.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth are the heaviest users of these weapons, with the Goblin Empire being a close second.</p>
<p>Much like crossbows, it takes time to reload a hand-cannon; for this reason, it is not uncommon to discard the hand-cannon after it has been fired, and the weapon is only retrieved and reloaded after combat.
This is especially likely to be the case if the weapon is not being carried by a team.</p>
<p>The projectiles fired by hand-cannons fly extremely rapidly, and are incredibly <em>hard to dodge</em> (this means that fray checks are divided by 2; see the <em>Guns</em> alternate rule).</p>

<h3 id="whip"><a class="header" href="#whip">Whip</a></h3>
<p>Whips are common tools for managing livestock and work-animals;
they consist of long, slender pieces of tanned leather.
Though they are very painful, they are not nearly as dangerous as purpose-built weapons, they are all but useless against even the slightest armor, and cannot be used to parry or defend against a close attacker.
Nevertheless, some do use them for self-defense, as a less-lethal weapon, to disarm opponents or to move small objects at range.</p>

Such a weapon might have an unreliable firing mechanism, or it might have a weaker shaft (owing to it being hollow to double as a barrel)—or it also might not! The weapon might be perfectly servicable as both an axe and matchlock. The choice is up to the player and the GM, and depends on what the CP cost of the weapon is, and what kind of “feel” the GM wants for the setting, and the player wants for their character.</em></p>
<p>A unique weapon built to order at great expense to the Dragonshire noble
that commissioned it, it was designed to make the might of gunpowder
available to its wielder without leaving them vulnerable in
close-combat. The axe’s shaft is reinforced, and also serves as the
barrel of a projectile weapon; the handle has a sophisticated,
matchlock-like mechanism to trigger the weapon.</p>

Heaters are cylindrical metal devices about the size and shape of the handle to a hammer; the tip of one end is lain with intricate steel wiring, while the other end is wrapped in leather.
When the device is activated, the wired tip becomes extremely hot.
The device requires a charge, a narrow alchemical rod that is fed into the handle end.
One charge is Trivial cost and will run the heater for 2 hours.
While there is a charge in it, the heater can be activated and deactivated with a metal trigger in the grip.</p>
<h4 id="safe-fall-cape"><a class="header" href="#safe-fall-cape">Safe-Fall Cape</a></h4>

These items are not always torques, although it is a common choice (given especially that many interact with the wearer's vocal cords).</p>
<p>Note that the Torque provides access to a <em>language group</em>—the sounds needed to speak a language—not dots in a language itself.

Just inside the linen lining there is a wrapping like a metallic ribbon; at several points along the back, there are pockets containing more of the metallic ribbons.
Both sets of ribbons cross are connected to two magical mechanisms, each a twin of the other, in the back of the suit.</p>
<p>In extreme cold, the external ribbons are left rolled up in their pockets.
When activated, the inner ribbons heat up, warming the wearer.
In extreme heat, the wearer opens the pockets and unfurls the ribbons, and the garment then pumps heat <em>out</em> through the unfurled ribbons, cooling the wearer.</p>
<p>If worn by a <em>warm-blooded</em> creature, the survival suit provides a +20 bonus to <em>Endure Physical Hardship</em> tests to survive extreme weather.
If worn by a <em>cold-blooded</em> creature, the survival suit allows the wearer to endure extremes of temperature as well as a warm-blooded creature.</p>
<p>The garment itself is tough, and provides some protection from damage.

<h4 id="the-bronze-arm"><a class="header" href="#the-bronze-arm">The Bronze Arm</a></h4>
<p>A magical item crafted for General Chandra to replace an arm lost in combat, this finely-crafted and mighty device has only made the general stronger.</p>
<p>The arm provides Chandra with +5 DUR, +5 STR and +2 AV.
Even though it is functionally a part of Chandra’s body, and he wields it as his own arm, it is still so powerful and durable that it counts as a weapon.
Chandra can attack with it using either the One-Handed Weapons or Unarmed skills, he is always considered armed, and he can even parry with it.</p>
<div class="asside">
<div class="asside-title">Designing the Bronze Arm</div>
<p>The Bronze Arm is an excellent item; it makes Chandra much better at his chosen role (an extreme-durability melee powerhouse) while it also helps underscores many of Chandra's themes (his wealth and nobility, his long experience on the battlefield, and his incredible durability).</p>
<p>Chandra's player specifically wanted the arm to be useful as a weapon in combat — he very specifically wanted to be able to parry with it; though it may seem like an afterthought, the fact that <em>Chandra is always considered armed, and can even parry with it</em> is perhaps the most important line of the description.</p>
<p>Chandra's player wanted to be able to shock people with the arm.
His GM was concerned that adding a shock effect to any melee damage Chandra did was too powerful — and besides, as an action, it should be a power.</p>
<p>Perhaps surprisingly, the bonus DUR, STR and AV was the GM's idea, offered as a compromise after moving the shock effect to a separate power.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="the-hunters-bow"><a class="header" href="#the-hunters-bow">The Hunter’s Bow</a></h4>
<p>A magical bow carried by Aryn the hunter, this weapon fires bolts of magic rather than arrows.</p>
<p>Since the bow fires magical projectiles that it generates, it does not require ammo.
(Note: since we normally do not track “basic” ammo, this detail is as much a narrative point as a functional rule.)</p>
<p>Besides functioning normally as a shortbow, the Hunter’s Bow has two alternate modes, controlled by a catch hidden in the wraps where Aryn grips it.</p>
<p>In “<strong>light</strong>” mode, the fired bolts do no damage, but they instead stick to whatever they strike and persist for several minutes, glowing brightly the entire time.
&quot;Light&quot; arrows glow quite brightly—they cast a white light as bright as a dozen candles, enough to see clearly for a dozen paces around the arrow.</p>
<p>In “<strong>track</strong>” mode bolt also does not damage, and also sticks to whatever target it strikes.
Rather than glowing brightly, tracking bolts are invisible (except, of course, to someone with Mage Sight).
Tracking bolts also last much longer—up to 3 days—although only one can be active at a time (if another one is fired, the first simply dissipates).
The bow pulses gently based on the whether the bow is facing towards the target, and whether the target is within range; this allows Aryn to use the bow to track a target struck by a tracker.
(The tracking bolt has a very long range—fully 500m.)</p>
<p>Being struck with a tracker bolt (or a light bolt, for that matter) feels somewhat like being pinched, but is otherwise harmless.</p>
<div class="asside">
<div class="asside-title">Designing the Hunter's Bow</div>
<p>The initial idea for Aryn's magical bow was that she would have unlimited ammo; as significant as this would be <em>in the world,</em> it is not mechanically useful, since we ordinarily do not track ammo anyway.</p>
<p>The <em>light</em> and <em>track</em> bolt-modes where added to underscore Aryn's role as a hunter — and in particular to be useful while delving into deep caves to fight the Leapers.</p>
<p>Aryn's player often requests a multi-shot power for the bow; some approve it, and some don't.
(Neither answer is correct — it's up to each GM.)</p>
</div>
<h4 id="flashback-anchor"><a class="header" href="#flashback-anchor">Flashback Anchor</a></h4>
<p>A magical device integrated into a vest Notebook wears, the Flashback Anchor allows her a chance to &quot;flashback&quot; from a jump — which allows her to attempt much more risky jumps than she otherwise could.
To be most effective, the device must be activated <em>before</em> a jump finishes to be effective — which is something of a problem.
When Notebook jumps, she experiences a blur of motion scarcely longer than a blink before appearing at her destination — she has that much time (and that much information about her destination) to decide if she needs to revert a jump.
Still, much like tripping off a bridge, a second to react and a chance to save herself is much better than nothing at all.</p>
<p>If the result of teleporting would injure or kill Notebook (or if she otherwise decides to revert a jump), she can roll COO+COO+INT; this represents both her ability to quickly perceive how her jump is going to end and to activate the Anchor.
If she succeeds, she successfully activates the Anchor, and reappears where her jump began, as though nothing had happened.
(If she is in initiative order, an appropriate action is still used — it still requires a Standard Action to use her Long Jump power, even if she decided to revert it.)</p>
<p>Even if she fails to activate the device, it still provides <em>some</em> protection: if Notebook arrives only partly in a solid object — or in some similar condition — the device will attempt to &quot;eject&quot; her from the obstruction, causing her to arrive next to it (if there is room).
This process is jarring — Notebook experiences a violent impact, like falling off roof: she takes 1d10 DV, and her armor does not apply.</p>
<div class="asside">
<div class="asside-title">Designing the Flashback Anchor</div>
<p>The design of the Flashback Anchor is pretty straight-forward: Notebook's ability to teleport was central to her player's design for her, and so they really wanted to be able to use it often — but the risk of being maimed or killed every time Notebook teleported somewhere she couldn't see was… inconvenient.</p>
<p>The Flashback Anchor gives Notebook an extra layer of protection when teleporting.
It doesn't guarantee her safety — since then she could &quot;brute force&quot; any building within range by teleporting at it over and over again — but it does give her a fighting chance if a jump goes wrong.</p>
<p>The design of the Flashback Anchor reflects the peculiar flair for danger and tough consequences of the GM that first approved it; other GM's might allow a similar device to completely and automatically save Notebook, but place some other limit on it (like a number of charges, for example, or a &quot;cooldown time&quot; after a failed jump).</p>

<p>The idea is that turning a canister of oil into an &quot;oil grenade&quot; is a trivial process — if you have a dose of oil, you can just stuff a rag into it, light it and throw it.
The same logic applies to the <em>scour</em> and <em>tar</em> chemicals, below.</p>

<h3 id="poppy-juice-drug-minor"><a class="header" href="#poppy-juice-drug-minor">Poppy Juice (Drug, Minor)</a></h3>
<p><em>Poppy juice</em> is brewed from poppies, and is used both medicinally and recreationally.
When taking, depending on the concentration, it masks pain; causes sluggishness and drowsiness; and confuses the sense and wits, bringing about hallucinations.</p>
<p>It can be useful in medical settings, as a treatment for physical pain; for some seizures and cramps, since it relaxes the muscles; and for some mental ailments, as it tranquilizes the mind.
However, it can be highly addictive, especially in concentration; for this reason, in the Commonwealth, it is only legal for its medical uses.
(Of course, it is also popular in drug dens, where it may be cut with other drugs.)</p>
<p>Overdoses can be fatal; one of the darker uses that physicians have put it to is to provide a gentle, painless death to the terminally ill and suffering.</p>

<h3 id="scour-chemical"><a class="header" href="#scour-chemical">Scour (Chemical)</a></h3>
<p><em>Scour</em> is a highly caustic chemical.
It is commonly used in some very specific professions, because it can break down stone, grim and metal.
However, scour is also very dangerous; it will cause terrible chemical burns, can dissolve flesh and bones, and is highly poisonous.
For this very reason, it is sometimes used as a (particularly cruel and terrible) weapon or poison.</p>
<ul>
<li>Scour can dissolve many substances, and causes terrible chemical burns.
<ul>
<li>An object (or character) covered in <em>Scour</em> takes 1D10 DV per turn.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Scour is thick and sticky, which makes it difficult to remove.
<ul>
<li>Fortunately, Scour dissolves in water, which makes it very easy to wash off (if water is available).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If ingested, Scour is lethal;
<ul>
<li>it deals 3D10 DV per turn until the character dies.</li>
<li>Fortunately, it is visually distinct (being a thick, pale, greenish paste), and the taste is obvious (and <em>horrible</em>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There are a few substances that <em>Scour</em> won't dissolve — among them glass and pottery.</li>

<h2 id="skill-kits-and-shops"><a class="header" href="#skill-kits-and-shops">Skill Kits and Shops</a></h2>
<p><em>Skill Kits</em> and <em>Shops</em> contain the tools and materials that characters use to practice a given trade, profession or skill; depending on the skill they're purchased for, they could include everything from a tent, a backpack, and flint to a legal books, paper, pen, and ink.</p>
<p>Skill kits, as the name implies, are smaller <em>kits</em>; they usually contain just the essentials, and are small enough to be portable (without the <em>Heavy</em> tag).
Shops are more extensive facilities — they represent officies, smithies, and libraries.
They contain far more equipment and resources, but aren't portable — they're large enough to fill a large room at least.
Shops provide a +10 bonus to checks made with the linked skill.</p>
<p>Skill kits and shops are associated with a specific skill, like <em>Survival</em> or <em>Profession: Lawyer</em>; we call that the <em>linked skill</em>.</p>
<p>Some tasks can't be attempted <em>without</em> a skill kit or shop; this is at the GM's discression.
Notably, most <em>Craft</em> skills can't be used without access to tools.</p>
<p>Normally, we don't track what's inside a skill kit or shop; we simply assume that they have any tool that is common and useful in the practice of a trade.
For example, we'd assume that a <em>Medicine</em> skill kit would have bandages, a needle and thread, and we'd assume that a Profession: Blacksmith shop would include an anvil and a forge.</p>
<p>When a character buys a skill kit or shop, they they <em>may</em> specify three items that the 'kit or shop definitely, specifically contains; this is useful for establishing that your character definitely has a particular <em>favorite blacksmith's hammer</em> in their blacksmith's shop, for example, without buying it separately; or establishing that their survival kit includes cold-weather clothing <em>in particular</em>.
When you buy a skill kit, you can name three [Minor] items that it definitely contains; when you purchase a shop, you can name up to six [Minor] and three [Major] items that it definitely contains.</p>
<h3 id="getting-items-out-of-a-kit"><a class="header" href="#getting-items-out-of-a-kit">Getting Items out of a 'Kit</a></h3>
<p>Sometimes characters will need a specific item, like a piece of rope, a piece or paper, a map of a region, or a tome on the laws of a specific culture.
How do they determine if their 'kits or shops have those items?</p>
<p>First, the GM decides if the item is a <em>common</em> tool, resource or supply for a given skill; a <em>possible</em> resource; or <em>impossible</em>.</p>
<p>If the resource the player is after is <em>common</em>, then the 'kit or shop simply has that item; this is at the GM's discretion, but GMs are encouraged to be generous.
For example, if a Character had a skill kit for their Profession: Lawyer, then, if they need paper, pen or ink, they could easily find those resources.
If the character lives in the Dragonshire, then it would certainly also have books on the law of the Dragonshire; it would probably be reasonable to assume that the kit also has books that cover the basic laws and customs of the territories around the Dragonshire — like Northland and Heartland provinces, and the Kingdoms of Men.</p>
<p>If the the character is after is <em>possible</em>, then they can roll a check using the linked skill; if they succeed, then the 'kit or shop had that item.</p>
<p>If the item is impossible, then the 'kit or shop doesn't have that item.</p>
<h3 id="travelling-and-shops"><a class="header" href="#travelling-and-shops">Travelling and Shops</a></h3>
<p>Shops, in general, aren't portable; if a character has a shop but needs to travel, they can produce a <em>skill kit</em> from the resources in their <em>shop</em>.
Ordinarily, this is a Task Action with a one hour time-frame, and requires a simple success check for the linked skill.
The check determines how well-stocked the kit is; a failure implies a -10 penalty for checks to locate <em>possible</em> items.</p>
<p>Shops are large enough that they can't be carried by a character, but that doesn't mean that they can't be moved <em>at all</em>.
Some vehicles are large enough to contain shops; the wagons that make up Halfling trade-caravans, for example, are large enough to carry shops — if only just.
Some large ships can also carry shops.</p>
<h2 id="creating-items"><a class="header" href="#creating-items">Creating Items</a></h2>
<p>Characters can use their Craft skills to create items directly.
This requires an appropriate <em>skill kit</em> or <em>shop</em>, raw materials, and at least <em>basic proficiency</em> in the craft skill to be used.</p>
<p>Normally, only a Simple Check is called for; a skilled blacksmith can make a spike, plow, or batch of nails without much chance of failure — although the time required or quality of work might vary.
Of course, a (normal) check can be called for under circumstances where failure is likely — such as when using improvised tools, or when rushing the job.</p>
<p>Normally, for Trivial, Minor, and Moderate items, we do not track raw materials; we assume that if you have a skill kit or shop, you have the resources that you need.
At the GM's discretion, Major and Extreme items may have special resource requirements — in particular, securing the resources to craft an Extreme item might be an adventure unto itself.</p>
<p>The time required to craft an item is at the GM's discretion, but we provide the following guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Trivial Item</strong>: two hour Task Action <em>per batch</em></li>
<li><strong>Minor Item</strong>: two hour Task Action</li>
<li><strong>Moderate Item</strong>: 1 shift Job</li>
<li><strong>Major Item</strong>: 20 shift Job</li>
<li><strong>Extreme Item</strong>: 150 shift Job</li>
</ul>
<div class="asside">
<p>Note that the crafting &quot;system&quot; as presented is somewhat minimal.
How do you know if you have raw materials?
Under reasonable circumstances, your character <em>just does</em>.
What does your character know how to make?
We haven't stated any limits to what your character knows, so they know how to make pretty much anything it's reasonable for them to make.
(Of course, <em>Knowledge</em> or <em>Craft</em> checks may be required for a character to know how to produce an <em>unusual</em>, <em>exotic</em> or <em>novel</em> item.)</p>
<p>This system is designed to be light-weight, and to allow <em>Crafter</em> characters to make a large impact on the game with minimal &quot;drag&quot;—if you've noticed that, taken together, this means that a party with a competent chemist can, for example, have basically as many jars of <em>Tar</em> as they want, then you're correct!
That's the reward for having a character who invested in chemistry.</p>
<p>Of course, that's not appropriate for all groups; some players might want a little more guidance on what's possible, or prefer a deeper system — and, conversely, some GM's might want to put more limits on what their crafters are capable of.
If you fall into either of those categories, consider the rules in <em>Advanced Crafting</em> in <em>Alternate Rules</em>.</p>
