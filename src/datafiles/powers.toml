You can throw an ally.
  - They must be at least one size category smaller than you (e.g. if you are Medium, you can throw a Small creature).
  - If you don't throw them farther than your medium range, they can land safely; if you throw them further than your medium range, they take damage as if they had fallen (1d10 DV at long range, 2d10 DV at Extreme range).
  - If the hurled creature lands at a lower point than when they where thrown, they take appropriate falling damage.
  - If you throw your ally at an opponent, and if they were prepared for it, then they are considered to have *charged*, and can attack the targeted opponent.
  - They can prepare as a Standard Action (during their turn), and are then considered to have "prepared" until their next turn."""
