## The Tour

The Commonwealth is broken into six provinces and three city-states.

# Provinces

## Heartland Province

Heartland Province sits between the Dragonshire to the north-east, the Goblins to the south-east, and the Worldspine to the west.
It is the birthplace of the Commonwealth, and remains a center of its wealth and prosperity.

### A History

Centuries before the Commonwealth Charter, the Empire of Man spread a sophisticated, urban culture Westward throughout the Emerald Plane (though often not to the benefit of those that they displaced).
Roads where cut through trackless forests, bridges where build, and walled cities of timber, plaster and stone where constructed throughout the eastern Emerald Plane — surrounded by small towns and hamlets, and criss-crossed with planted fields and orchards.
Titles where given to the wealthy, connected and powerful citizens of the Three Cities, along with lands in the frontiers; these Lords where permitted to organize their territories as they saw fit, subject to (and supported by) local governors and commanders in nearby cities.

In the Year of the Old Empire 226 (CY -227), the Dragon Karrach lead a rebellion in the lands between the Golden Peninsula (and the original Three Cities of the Empire of Man) and the rest of the Emerald Plane; this cut the Imperial territory further inland to the west off from Imperial control.

These isolated territories had little desire to come back under Imperial rule.
Once, they where the frontiers of a growing Empire of Man; after more than a century, they had grown settled and prosperous in their own right — and had begun to develop their own local centers of power.
Karrach's rebellion left those regions free of the levies and taxes owed to the Empire of Men and the distant Three Cities — and free of the threat of the Empire's army, however little that threat had meant in the frontier.
Their far more immediate concern might have been Karrach himself; however, it was quickly understood that the Empire of Man was a far greater concern to Kerrach than the lands to his west, and that he had little interest in claiming more distant territories — territories that he likely could not control any more than the Empire could.

The culture in those areas in the west, between Karrach and the Worldspine, continued to grow, prosper and evolve.
Member of existing communities left to found new manors in the sparsely-populated lands to the west, south and north.
Trade-routes where established, and cities grew.
Some of the larger cities became city-states, and centers of regional power — the guarantors of peace and security in the surrounding territories.
This system proved adaptable and flexible, and a web of *greater* and *lesser* city-states, manors and hamlets continued to spread West throughout the Emerald Plane.

Free of the rule of the Empire, and equipped with a flexible system for the distribution of power, those early Human city-builders began to find ways to peacefully integrate other cultures into their own.
In the Year-of-the-Old-Empire 241 (CY -211), Halflings where encountered; they had a mercantile culture, where the young and able-bodied travelled for trade.
Several Halfling clans where granted charters in the periphery of the web of manors, and soon Halfling traders began to spread throughout the region.

Then, in Year-of-the-Old-Empire 289 (CY -163), a confederation of Gnollish tribes turned on one of their tributaries and sought to exterminate them; this clan of Gnolls came to the lesser Human city-state of *Autumn's Folk* for aide.
Fatefully, Geoph, the governor of Autumn's Folk, agreed to help them; he promised them shelter within the city's walls and the charter to a manor, if they agreed to respect Autumn's Folk as the guarantor of their charter — and to aid them against the Gnollish confederation that was now their common enemy.
The refugees accepted.
The confederation was met in battle, and a force of Humans and Gnolls repulsed them; the Gnollish refugees where granted a charter, and constructed a manor of their own.

Access to the strength and durability of Gnolls proved a powerful advantage; strong and durable, Gnolls found a place anywhere there was hard work to be done.
Gnolls took well to farming — surprising to some, but strength and endurance are incredibly valuable for farm-work, and their scavenger's ability to consume spoiled meat is invaluable in lean years.
They also quickly found a place as hired guards with Halfling trading caravans, and proved invaluable in times of war.
Though originally only a single tribe was granted a manor, they prospered; their numbers grew, and their kinsman came to join them.

These Gnolls, Humans and Halflings prospered.
In Year-of-the-Old-Empire 304 (CY -148), a *charter* was signed — now called the Old Charter — to govern the cooperation between the Gnollish tribe, their Human allies, and local Halflings; it provided a framework for a peaceful and prosperous collaboration, but was written in the form of an agreement between manors.
Other manors and city-states signed it, agreeing to cooperate for their mutual prosperity, and a manorial, mercantile, prosperous and diverse culture began to spread throughout the Emerald Plane; first, the existing Human manors joined, and then it continued to spread.
However, the Old Charter was written primarily as an agreement between manors, and proved inadequate to governing a growing and rich network of cities, manors and peoples.
In Year-of-the-Old-Empire 452 (CY 1), the Commonwealth Charter replaced the Old Charter; it established the Commonwealth Council, who had the power to ley taxes and duties, and to dispense them to build roads and bridges, and to fund an army.

The Commonwealth expanded; it grew northward, eventually encountering Dwarves; it spread east, around the southern extends of the Dragonshire, and met the Goblins' borders; it crossed the world-spine, encountering many new races and cultures — and the Shade Elves, who became one of the principles of the Shaded-Sea Peoples; and eventually crossed the Sunset Gulf and settled the Haven Isles.
And it prospered: many new races great and small where incorporated; trade blossomed; and the exchange of knowledge, art and culture flourished.

In CY 744, the Commonwealth Compact replaced the Commonwealth Charter.
Besides adding several new peoples as members, it divided the Commonwealth into provinces — Heartland Province consisting of the Commonwealth's oldest territories, those between the Dragonshire and the Worldspine.

### Culture

The influence of the culture of the Empire of Man can still be seen in Heartland Province.
Especially in the east, ancient cities constructed by Human settles from the Empire still stand.
The language, Weal, is derived from the ancient language of the Empire of Man — although it has changed significantly.
However, this ancient culture has changed radically over the centuries — sometimes dramatically and quickly, as new races and cultures joined the Commonwealth.

#### Cities

Heartland Province is prosperous, established and secure; thus, it is home to a number of large cities — ranging from one-quarter to three-quarters of a *demarc* across, and with populations ranging from the tens to hundreds of thousands.
These large cities can be almost dizzyingly diverse.
In them, one can find representatives of nearly every race and culture of the Emerald Plane.
Humans are the majority there, Halflings are common, and Ratfolk and Kobolds populations are growing rapidly; however, there are always representatives from countless rarer races and cultures.

> *River:* That's what I love about Heartland Province; you can find anyone and anything here.
> In Saint-Silver City, where I'm from, there's a restaraunt run by a member of race like a giant mantis.
> They'll pickle or ferment almost anything — they have the most delicious-
>
> *Track:* Thank you, River, we get the point.

The Empire of Man were known for a unique and sophisticated style of urban construction, featuring sophisticated masonry, strong city-walls, regular streets laid out in a grid, buildings of dressed stone, and sophisticated sewerage systems.
Early in its history, this kind of construction was common in Heartland, but, over the centuries, as new races and cultures have been incorporated and new technologies and designs have been developed, urban construction has become more varied and sophisticated.
Cities in the northeast, near the Dragonshire and Kings' Sea, are often constructed in an older style, and are more likely to have prominent walls; cities in the interior of the province, closer to the Worldspine, are often constructed in newer and more varied styles and, being less likely to suffer invasion or threat, are less likely to have prominant city walls.
The use of free-standing supports and sophisticated arches have become common, making it possible to construct buildings with high ceilings, thin walls and wide windows.
Some innovations have been aimed at making urban construction cheaper, as well; brick and timber-frame have become more common, for example, as they are cheaper than stone-masonry.

The Commonwealth's large cities have also long been colorful and lavishly decorated.
Mosaics have always been common in Heartland, with public spaces often feature tile mosaics on the floors and walls; as the region has grown rich and prosperous, and as other cultures have been incorporated, many other artforms have become common.
Gnolls brought a tradition of ornate wood-carvings, often worked into the frames and timbers of houses, and a kind of intricate relief carving often worked into bone and stone.
Within the last two centuries, frescoes have become particularly common, and often adorn public buildings, temples, and the homes of the wealthy.
Public performance is also extremely common in Heartland, with street-musicians, recitation, and theatre being common.

#### The Countryside

If its rich, colorful and diverse cities define Heartland in the mind of many foreigners, they are not, however, where most people actually live.
The vast majority of those who live in Heartland Province live in rural manors, hamlets and small freeholds.

More than a millenium ago, the Empire of Man settled its western frontier — what would become Heartland Province — by granting a title, land, and often slaves to a noble, general or elite; these *Lords* would then establish a small, self-sufficient town (a *manor* or *villa*) in their land, to be worked by their tenents (both free and slave) and governed under Imperial authority.
Normally, the Lord would claim roughly a third of the land as their own, with the other two-thirds granted to the Lord's tenants; tenants where required to work the Lord's land, in exchange for the rule and protection of the Lord and, by proxy, the Empire.

However, far from the centers of Imperial power, in the vast and distant frontier, the rule of Lords and was often tenuous, and Lords could struggle to maintain control of their tenants.
While peasant uprisings did occur, defection was far more common; many tenants, faced with poor treatment, would gather compatriots, defect from their Lord's service, travel a *demar* or two away, and found their own manor — sometimes naming one of their own as "Lord," sometimes not.
In principle, the right of the Lord to his tenents' labor should have been protected by the Empire; in practice, most governors and commanders did not have the military resources to "retrieve" defectors in all the territories they where responsible for — nor in fact the motivation, as long as the new manor was willing to pay at least notioal deference to the Imperial government in the cities.

This method of social arrangement — small, nearly-self-sufficient communities, sometimes held by a "legitiamte" lord and sometimes not — proved to be flexible and effective.
As the distant Empire was cut off, the web of cities and manors continued to spread; members of established communities would depart, claim a swath of land in the frontier, and organize it as a small, self-sufficient community of their own.
These communities could be set-up as the residents wished, or as necessity demanded — the system proved to be remarkably adaptible.
Sometimes, these communities where organized by an wealthy individual (much like a Lord of old); other times, they might be organized by an organization, like a temple or guild; still other times, they could be organized by a family, clan, or group of peasants, who simply wanted to establish a community of their own.
Sometimes, manors might seek little more than to feed their residents; other times, they might support a guild, monastery or college that held their charter; and still other times they might host a small number of local artisens.
One notable deficiency, given the absence of the former Imperial army, was security; city governors often attempted to step into this void, styling their city as a seat of authority and protection for the surrounding manors.
This arrangement was often tenuous.

It was this manorial culture that spawned the Charter, and established the Commonwealth.
Today, Heartland Province is no longer the frontier, and there is very little free land to claim; it is covered in manors, hamlets and freeholds.
Many of these settlements are centuries-old; some are still organized and run much as they have been for centuries, while others have changed significantly in the last nine hundred years.

The typical manor is small, between one-quarter and three-quarters of a *demarc* across.
In most, houses are constructed near the center — often of brick or timber-frame — along with workshops and public buildings; the surrounding area is broken into a patchwork of irregular, rectangular fields.
(Farming techniques in Heartland are sophisticated, including the rotation of several crops across several fields; because of this, the fields are often a patchwork of color, with some fallow, some planted, and some ready for harvest.)
Some may have a prominent manor-house or town hall, while in others, the holder of the charter may be distant.

Hamlets and freeholds are often smaller, consisting of only a few families and their attendant fields.

Gnolls make up half the populations of the manors and freeholds of rural Heartland Province, Humans claim roughly three-tenths, and Halflings one-tenth; the remaining one-tenth is composed of a diverse array of races, including a growing number of Ratfolk and Kobolds.
Most manors will consist prominently of one orace or another — less because of any kind of tension or prejudice, and more because it's easier to share a community with people who share a diet, can speak one-another's language, and can produce children.
(Notably, it's very common for nearby manors to have deep and long-enduring connections, often across racial lines; this is especially true of the symbiotic relationship between Gnoll and Halfling communities.)

#### Gnollish Culture

The Gnolls who settled near Autumn's Hold largely assimilated into the human culture that sheltered them, and the culture that dominates in the Gnoll-held manors and freeholds today largely descends from those first refugees.
Stories of their ancestor's flight from their cousins, of building a new home among Humans and Halflings, and of the new prosperity they helped to build, are prominent parts of their culture and folklore today.
Many Gnolls take great pride in the roll their ancestors played in founding and securing the Commonwealth, and as one of its great pillars today.

Most Gnollish manors herd sheep, goats, and cattle; they also raise a number of crops, including a wide variety that they cannot eat, which they grow for export.

#### The Caravans

### Law and Government

Though some other provinces have sophisticated governments or administrations, Heartland Province is still organized much as it always has been — as a vast network of cities, manors, hamlets and freeholds
Each must comply with the Commonwealth Compact; a number of other agreements are also commonly in effect, the better to govern and administer the territory; beyond these agreements, however, each manor is only ruled by the city-seat that granted its charter, and each city-seat is a peer and a law unto itself.

Law in Heartland can be extremely complex.
Each city has its own unique blend of common law, civil law, contract and custom.
Navigating this web of custom and treaty can be extremely complicated — although, since the wealth of the Commonwealth was built on trade, most cities and manors adopt laws and customs designed to smooth trade and accommodate travellers, traders and visitors.
(For example, since Commonwealth Charter, the maximum penalty for all but high crimes is expulsion from the city or manor.)

Most manors have *law-boards* at prominant entrances, summarizing important (or surprising) elements of local law.
Travellors are well-advised to consult these boards: the law in most manors is unsurprising, but some have can have unusual customs and obligations.

### Major Spirit: Saint Silver

**Basin:** Markets, Trade, Roads, Architecture, Crafts

**Manifestation:** A young Halfling male with light sandy skin and short, dark hair.

**Propitiation:** Coins are given at offering boxes at market entrances; coins left on window-cills, threshold or fence-posts, as cherity; small ammounts of valuable commodities are burned, including spices, wheat and flour.

**Binds:** None known.

**Symbols:** Coins, Wheat, Emerald Cloth, scales.  His colors are silver, emerald and gold.

Saint Silver was a halfling merchant who lived in the early Commonwealth; he was born in Year-of-the-Old-Empire 283, and was was a young, independant trader in YOE 304, when the Old Charter (as it is now called) was signed.
Saint Silver was an active supporter of the Old Charter, and embraced his new Gnollish neighbors.
He traded actively among Human, Halfling, and the nascent Gnollish communities; he was an early supporter for unity, equality, cooperation and trade between the communities, and supported closer integration throughout his life.
By the end of his life in YOE 407, he had earned close friends and great respect amongst all three communities, and could take pride in having been an integral part of the success of the early Charter; upon his death, he was Elevated by Sena, Mother-Market and Sellem, Witness to Contracts, and given as his basin the markets, fields and roads of the forming Commonwealth.

Today, Saint Silver is associated with markets as a benevolant force, tying communities together in trade and seeing to the propserity of all.
Icons of Saint Silver can be found in markets throughout the Commonwealth, but are especially common and prominent in Heartland Province.
He is also associated with skilled work and crafts, and is often honored in guild-halls; he is also associated with charity, and many of his rituals and feasts involve the giving of alms for the poor.
He is also commonly revered by many Halfling, for perhaps obvious reasons; his symbols have also become common among the mercantile Ratfolk of the Commonwealth, who picked up his rituals from the Halfling traders with whome they have frequent contact.

### Major City: Saint-Silver's Hold

[[abstract]]

|Saint-Silver's Hold is a city of half a million people located near the center of Heartland Province.
|It is one of Heartland's major trade-hubs.

|Population: 550,000

|Common Languages: Weal, Heartland Gnoll, Autumn Caravaneer, Cqik, High Kobold, Rak, *more*

|Common Races: Human (50%), Gnoll (15%), Halfling (15%), Ratfolk (10%), Kobolds (5%), *more*
|
|Location: central Heartland, on the Swiftsilver River
|
|Industries: trade, banking, universities, law, governance

Saint-Silver's Hold is a large city in central Heartland Province, sitting on the western banks of the Swiftsilver River about 110 *demarc* from the coast.
The city sits on two major trade-routes: the Swiftsilver river carries substantial trade to the cost — being calm enough to safely navigate, despite its name — and the Drake's High Road running between the Worldspine and the Dragonshire.
The original walls of the Old City still stand, nestled in the heart of the modern city, where the Drake's Road crosses the Swiftsilver; however, over the centuries of peace since the Commonwealth's founding, the city has expanded massively.
It's current walls enclose a long, bulging stretch along the western banks of the river, fully a *demarc* and a half north-to-south, and a third of a *demarc* at its widest east-to-west — and districts of the city have spilled out of its current walls.

Saint-Silver's Hold is only informally devoted to Saint Silver; while the government of the city has not formally devoted itself to him, his veneration and symbols are common throughout — as are markets, fittingly enough.
Saint-Silver's Hold is a major trade-hub, with multiple great markets both in and outside of its walls.
It also houses a number of prominent banks, including one of the Commonwealth's Council Banks — making it a vital hub of the Commonwealth's financial system.
The city is also known for a large public hospital funded by a tax on the markets (Saint Silver being a benevolant spirit, after all); being rich and cosmopolitan, the city also hosts a number of universities, libraries and guild-halls.

Its status as a trade-hub — and the presence of a Commonwealth Council institution — means that the city has been selected to host a meeting of the Commonwealth Council before.
In its long history, the city has hosted 11 sessions of the Commonwealth Council; not nearly as many as Southharber, perhaps, but still an honor.

Notably, if it isn't quite the seat of power that Southharbor or Crossroads are, the city never-the-less plays a major role in the Commonwealth's diplomacy — since coins minted in Saint-Silver's banks can reach parts of the Goblin Empire of Kingdoms of Men that the Commonwealth's diplomats and soldiers cannot.

### Major City: Autumn's Folk

[[abstract]]
|
|While not the most prosperous city in Heartland, Autumn's Folk is notable for it's major role in the history of the Commonwealth.
|
|---
|
|Population: 230,000
|
|Common Languages: Weal, Heartland Gnoll, Autumn Caravaneer, Cqik
|
|Common Races: Human (65%), Gnoll (10%), Halfling (10%), Ratfolk (20%), *more*
|
|Location: south-central Heartland
|
|Industries: Blacksmiths' and Masons' guilds, trade, fishin, agriculture adn aquaculture

Autumn's Folk is located in the south-central part of Heartland Province, a bit less than 5 *demarc* from the coast.
It is situated north and east of a large swatch of wetland that runs to the Glass Sea to the south.
The marsh was a problem to early settlers; while the soil was rich, the water was slow and stagnant, and thus the marsh was not fit for agriculture, nor the water for human use.
(This latterw as a particular concern, as there weren't any other sources of fresh water nearby.)
Unfortunately, local spirits absolutely forbid draining or diverting the swamp.

The early settlement was saved from disaster when a local spirit, the Autumn Lord, revealed the location of a large, freshwater spring it controlled, and granted the human settlers its use — provided they did not despoil the spring, and held for it a feast-day.
Sicne then, the Autumn Lord has been something of a patron and protector for Autumn's Folk; it has negotiated for them the ability to use parts of the marsh for aquaculture, it has helped them to water to irrigate their fields, and it has used their influence to keep safe their harvests.
In turn, the people of Autumn's Hold continue to honor the Autumn Lord.

Eventually, Autumn's Folk was able to grow into a regional power worthy of being called a city-state.
And it was, of course, the city-state where then-governor Geoph granted a Gnollish tribe a charter, and where the Old Charter was first drafted, with Human, Halfling and Gnollish signatories — making it the site of the founding of the Commonwealth.

While Autumn's Folk is both prosperous and historic, its growth is still limited by the vast stretch of marsh to its west, and by the ammount of water that the Autumn Lord can provide for irrigation.
Because of this, despite its historical importance, it is not among the largest and most powerful of the Commonwealth's cities.

### Major Cite: Geoph's Legacy

[[abstract]]
|
|Heartland Province hosts a Commonwealth Council Library at *Geoph's Legacy*.
|
|---
|
|Location: north-central Heartland, near the Dragonshire border

When the Compact replaced the Charter, the Commonwealth was broken into provinces.
Most provinces have a provincial government and a provincial capital — but Heartland Province does not.
This created a problem, as Commonwealth Council institutions operating in Heartland Province needed to be based somewhere.
Rather than put them in Prosperity — which was officially a city-state independent of Heartland — a site was selected to construct a *campus* that would house Heartland's provincial Council offices; it was called "Geoph's Legacy".

*Geoph's Legacy* is a small campus measuring roughly 250 strides north-to-south and 330 east-to-west; it is located in the north-central part of Heartland, situated a little less than three *demarc* from the border with the Dragonshire.
Geoph's Legacy is built like a small city; it is walled and laid out with regular roads, with the important Commonwealth offices situated at its center, arranged around a public square.
It contains a Commonwealth Council Archive, a Library, a Treasury, and a Hall.
It also contains an office for the Generals of Heartland Province, and a small garrison built into the center of the north wall — although, in practice, visiting military commanders typically operate out of *Geoph's Star*, a large star-fort a demarc and a half to the north-east.
It also contains a temple — not officially a Council institution, although it frequently plays a prominent ceremonial role.

Geoph's Legacy *does* have residents, although not many.
The Council Administrator for Heartland Province lives in Geoph's Legacy, as do a number of subordinate ministers and officers; a number of the administrators and functionaries that work in the Commonwealth Council facilities also live in the 'Legacy.
However, many Commonwealth provincial officials actually live (and work) in *Carved-Balance City*, a city of about 150,000 located a *demarc* to the southeast, and only travel to Geoph's Legacy as necessary.

In Heartland fashion, rather than arrange for a tax to fund the city, or have the Commonwealth Council pay for it's operation Geoph's Legacy was granted the charter to several surrounding manors, under the auspices of *Carved-Balance City*; those manors currently support the campus with food and labor.

### Common Language: Weal

[[abstract]]
|
|A language commonly spoken by Humans in Heartland Province.
|
|Group: HHED
|
|Partially Intelligeble: Old Imperial, Royal, other derivatives of Old Imperial

Weal — or some local variant of it — is spoken throughout Heartland and Westward, and is not-uncommon throughout the rest of the Commonwealth.
It is derived from Old Imperial — the language of the Empire of Man — but has changed substantially.
In turn, it was carried throughout the Emerald Plane by Commonwealth explorers and settlers, where it has influenced or blended with other languages.

## Dragonshire Province

The Dragonshire sits between Heartland Province to the west and south and the Kingdom of Men to the north; it also borders on the Glass Sea, where, in other times, it might do brisk trade with the Human and Goblin nations.

[[abstract]]

|A province long defined by the cooperative co-evolution of its Dragon and Drake nobility, its elites, its guilds, and its common folk.

### History

#### Founding

Centuries ago, before the first Charter, the land that would become Heartland Province was cut off from Empire of Man when the dragon named Karrach led a rebellion — supported by a faction of the local wealthy and Imperial administrators — that allowed him to claim a swath of Imperial territory for his own.
(Karrach could speak Old Imperial, and gave "Karrach" as his name when addressing Humans in their own language; in Commonwealth Standard, he is called the Red-Scaled King.)
The territory, once the frontier of the Empire, had grown wealthy and urban in its own right, and the elite of these new cities chaffed at their duties to the distant Three Cities; in Karrach and his kin, they had a chance at independence.

The rebellion began in early winter in Year-of-the-Old-Empire 226 (CY -227), in a year when the army was not mustered; Karrach's rebellion had only to subdue the local garrisons, which was easy enough if they where denied the support and quarter of the locals.
Forces from further west where cut off form Imperial command; and also frequently found that they could not depend on the support of the locals — west of the Dragonshire, there was no great love of the Three Cities.
Cut off from much of their territory beyond the Golden Plane — and with much of their distant territory having no great willingness to pay tribute to the distant Three Cities or comply with a levy — the Empire of Man found it difficult to muster an army to reclaim their lost territory.

Karrach granted his kin noble titles, and shared the rule of the Dragonshire with them; however, their numbers where few — enough so that they could not control their new territory without the tacit consent of the elites among their new territories.
The two consequences of this — the need for the Dragon nobility to compensate for their small numbers, and their need to maintain the support of the Human populace — shaped much of the Dragonshire's early history.

Karrach immediately began to enlist the support of other Dragons; beyond his immediate kin, he extended an offer of land and title to any other dragon who would bow to his rule — as long as they had the wisdom to keep the good will of the Human subjects they ruled.
Dragons are few, long-lived and cautious — but Karrach's terms where generous; a steady stream of dragons came to serve him, and where granted lands and titles.
In the Dragonshire's early years, Karrach distributed lands carefully among his new nobles, and kept a careful watch over them — even as he desperately needed a dragon nobility to govern his new territory, he could not afford for them to be disloyal or incompetent.

Early on, even while the Empire of Man desired to regain their former lands, the wealthy of the Dragonshire and their new Dragon lords tested one another.
In the short term, Karrach preserved the system of taxes and levies that the Empire had used; he used the taxes to fund a small professional force, and a levy of labor to both grow those ranks and to upgrade the fortifications along his eastern border.
Ultimately, Karrach and his nobles cooperated with his Human subjects much more than they undermined each other; while the elite among his Human subjects did attempt, as ever, to avoid his taxes and levies, they ultimately had to ensure that Karrach's forces remained strong enough to repel the coming attack from the Empire of Man.

In Year-of-the-Old-Empire 231 (CY -221), 234 (CY -218) and 241 (CY -211), the Empire made attempts to regain the Dragonshire; each was repelled.
During this time, the Dragon and Human populations found ways cooperate with one-another, and built a body of custom and agreement that would continue to serve them after the immediate threat of Imperial reclamation subsided.

Ultimately, though, Karrach knew that he could not depend on a few dragons — from distant lands, with no bond of kinship or prior culture — to rule his lands; he needed a *people*.
He put out a call to any Great Spirit who could provide him with one; ultimately, in Year-of-the-Old-Empire 331 (CY -121), he was answered by a mercurial and mysterious spirit, which variably identified itself as *the Bulrush God*, *the Rainstorm Shepherd* and *the Osprey’s Father*, amongst other names.
The *Bulrush God* gave Karrach the ability to crate *holy sites*, and a ritual that they could perform there to turn a *dragon's* egg into an egg for a new type of creature — a *drake*.
Drakes where smaller and less powerful than dragons, but far more fecund; they would provide Karrach with his *people*.

Early on, Karrach pursued peace and good relations with the former Imperial territories to his west — what would become the Commonwealth.
His enemy was the Empire of Man, who would attempt to bring his territory back under their control.
This peaceful relationship continued as the Commonwealth formed and the Empire of Man weakened and collapsed; the Dragonshire was a useful barrier between the free lands to the west and the Empire, and trade between the Commonwealth and Dragonshire was highly profitable.
In CY 17 a peace-treaty was signed, and in CY 41 the Commonwealth and Dragonshire became allies; this proved invaluable to both.
Besides continuing prosperous trade, the two profited from being "brothers back-to-back" — the border between the Dragonshire and Commonwealth could be undefended, so that the Commonwealth could focus on fighting the Shaded Sea while the Dragonshire focused on resisting the Empire of Man (and, later, the Kingdoms of Men).

The pair also had a mutual enemy in the Goblin Kingdoms.
As early as Year-of-the-Old-Empire 231, almost two hundred years before the Commonwealth formed (CY -194), an alliance of powerful Goblin Kings on their northern shore rose to threaten both the Empire of Man and the Dragonshire — which forced the weakening Empire to abandon its attempts to reclaim the Dragonshire, but also furnished both the Empire and the Dragonshire with a new enemy.
The Goblin Kingdoms would remain a vital enemy after the Empire of Man collapsed in CY 87, continuing to threaten the Commonwealth and Dragonshire for almost four centuries; the power of the Goblin Kings finally broke with a disastrous failed invasion of the Dragonshire and Commonwealth in CY 148.

The collapse of the Empire in CY 87 and the failure of the Goblin assault in CY 148 marked the ascendancy of the "brothers back-to-back" as the preeminent power on the Emerald Plane.

Ultimately, the Kingdoms of Men would rise from the ashes of the Empire of Man; successive eras of Goblin power would also come and go.
Through the centuries, the Commonwealth and Dragonshire remained powerful allies; finally, in CY 744, the Dragonshire joined the Commonwealth as a province.

#### Sharing Power

Over time, power in the Dragonshire has tended away from the nobility, and towards the general populace.

In CY 177, the elites of Forge-of-the-Mountaineers — its wealthy guildsmen, landlords and land-holders, and clergy — formed the Steel Council, to concentrate their political power when dealing with the Lord Steel; they where careful not to overstep their bounds, and the Lord Steel shrewdly considered their "council."
In the following years, more "Freeman's Councils" where formed — and met with greater and lesser degrees of acceptance, depending on how bold they where, and how accommodating the local Lords where.
In CY 197, Karrach issued the Free-Council Decree, which formally granted the elite of his territories the right to form Freeman's Councils — and spelled out what conditions those councils had to meet, and what obligations the Lords did and did not have to them.

As Karrach's domain grew and prospered, so to did the wealth and power of its common population.
Karrach had abolished Slavery as such in CY 16; in CY 241, he formally limited the conditions that could be placed on tenants and bondsmen — effectively increasing the basic right guaranteed to (almost) all in his domain.
(These changes where resisted by the Freeman's Councils, whose elite membership resented the reduction of their power).
In CY 244, Karrach issued the sweeping Citizen's Reform; this granted every resident on his domains the status of a Citizen, and spelled out the minimum rights and privileges guaranteed to each Citizen.
It also create the Citizen's Councils (which where open to any Citizen who did not meet the property requirements for the Freeman's Councils) and the Guild's Councils (to which every guild in a manor could elect a representative).

Growing pressure from the Second High Kingship (starting in the Kingdoms of Men in CY 361) and the first King-by-the-Assembly (appointed by the Goblin's Noble Assembly in 378) began to lay bare the need for a more efficient, centralized bureaucracy.
Rather than attempt to consolidate power under himself — a move that, besides being less than moral, would have been resisted by the Freeman's and Citizen's Councils, at a time that the Dragonshire could ill afford internal conflict — Karrach began to work on a centralized body drawn from his Nobles and their Councils, that could govern with the support of the all the Dragonshire's various classes and interests.
In CY 391, after much political negotiation, Karrach, with the support of his nobles and a large majority of their Freeman's, Citizen's and Guild's councils, created the Dragonshire Parliament, and reorganized much of the Dragonshire's government beneath it.
The Parliament consisted of three chambers: the Noble's Chamber, representing those with titles; the Elite's Chamber, representing the Dragonshire's monied and propertied interests; and the Citizen's Chamber, which represented the common citizenry.
(Though he had abandoned direct control over the administration of the Dragonshire, Karrach remained its king, and became also the Lord of the Noble's Chamber.)

### The Culture of the Dragonshire

### The Dragonshire's Military

### The Northland Corridor

The Northland Corridor is a strip of land running north-to-south along the Worldspine Mountain.
Historically, the area was settled by both the Commonwealth and Dragonshire — leaving control of the area disputed.
The dispute was settled in CY 65, when an agreement seeded the territory to the Dragonshire, under the condition the Dragonshire had to allow the Commonwealth-aligned settlements to operate under certain terms of the Commonewalth Charter, and that the Dragonshire had to allow Commonwealth traders free travel through the area.

The Northland Corridor became something of a vital trade route, connecting the Commonwealth to the south with the Dwarves and Orcs to the north — what would eventually become Northland Province.

Even now that the Dragonshire is a province of the Commonwealth, the Northland Corridor remains an important trade route, connecting Heartland and Northland provinces.

> Katarina: the complex web of legal statuses in the Corridor — combined with the fact that, historically, traders from Heartland could just wander through there half-outside the Dragonshire's jurisdiction — has meant that there's been a fair amount of smuggling going through Northland.

### Major City: Stormsword's Rest

[[abstract]]
|
|Stormswor'd Rest is a small walled city straddling a narrow pass that leads west across the Worldspine.
|Well-fortified and highly-definsible, it guards the east against campaigns launched out of the independant territories of the northwest, or by unaligned Orcs and Dwarves; it also hosts some of the Dragonshire's premier war-colleges.
|Both controlling one of the rare passes through the Worldspine and sitting in the Northland Corridor, it is also a major trade hub.
|It is also a polyglot city, hosting populations from a dizzying array of races, many from outside the Commonwealth (possibly owing to being a major center of High Road activiy).

Stormsword’s Rest is a large walled township that sits in the northwest of the Dragonshire Province, in the lower peaks in the northeast fringe of the Worldspine Mountain.
It covers a narrow pass through the Worldspine Mountains, which rises to the West; to the East, it looks down on rugged highlands, rolling foothills and river-run lowlands of the Northland Corridor.
The region is known as the Worldspine Pass March; though small, it is strategically vital for the Dragonshire, as it sits at the nexus of two trade-routes, and in particular controlls access to the Dragonshire from north-west Northland Province.
(In the taxonomy of the Dragonshire, a *township* is something larger than a village, but smaller than a city proper; a township typically has one or more temples, one or more market-ssquares, a noble leige and some form of garrison.)

Despite a lack of local material, the township is home to several stonemason, blacksmith and carpentry workshops; the apprentices of these shops are highly valued for their skills throughout the Dragonshire and Greater Commonwealth.
To the east, the rough highlands lend themselves to herding sheep and goats, and fertile but hard land supports a few scattered orchards.
To the west, in the pass proper, there are quarries that date back to the original construction of the town’s walls.

The township itself sits at the mouth of the pass, encircled by walls in concentric rings, the outer of which reach the sides of the valley itself.
Dense structures fill the residential blocks, larger buildings straddling the streets with bridges.
On the northern edge of the city, perched atop a retainer wall, there is a relatively large university, famous for it’s natural philosophy lectures.
To the southern edge, a military academy sits atop its own wall, training Dragonshire officers for the Commonwealth Military.

The town's population is diverse.
Topside, the town is dominated by Gnolls, Humans, and Drakes; tunnels in the northern valley-wall and southern retaining walls lead underground to a community of Kobolds, Dwarves, Ash Elves.
Sitting on the passageway through the worldspine, Stormsword’s Rest is also often host to a large population of traders and wagoneers.
The population of the town has exploded in recent times, with an oddly high number of escaped and former slaves taking up residence.

The town’s symbol, and the symbol of its ruling family, is a black image of an open gatehouse, overlaid on a fortified tower and sitting upon a red field.
It is often joined by a smaller crest, of a black-blue and brown-green field, with a silver or white dragon skull and mangrove tree.
The town is constructed largely of grey stone and imported woods, and the limited pallet of colours is offset by bright banners and pennants in the colours of the town, and the commonwealth as a whole.
Large painted murals and colourful mosaics decorate where they can, and small, well-maintained window gardens are a source of pride in the densely-built blocks of the city.

Stormsword Manor itself sits at the centre of town.
It is a single, fortified tower with an undying flame at it’s top, atop a slight rise that has been manicured into angular and refined gardens for public use.
The manor-house is a later construction; it is slightly curved, and built into the foundations of the tower.
It has a relatively plain frontage, and its doors are opened to all.
The main floor is given over to the town council and administration, with the Marchess's home starting on the second floor.

To the western edge of the town is the main mustering-point of the Northwestern Levee, a powerful military division lead by the General Stormsword.
Professional soldiery is housed and trained there, and volunteers, conscripts, and draftees will assemble there in times of war and strife.

On the outskirts of the farms to the east, there is a large, well-appointed Dancing Hawk stable, where the Marchess indulges in her hobby of breeding and training the animals.

The township is relatively orderly, but there is still a criminal underbelly, making use of deep shadows and alleyways.
Smugglers and shady groups have a notable presence, as they do throughout the Northland Corridor.
They dominate underworld dealings, and have an all-but-open relationship with the town council – despite the Stormswords' best efforts.

The town is also notable for its guilds and trade-unions.
Bargaining blocks of tradespeople and farmers, establishing standards of practice and allowing for a unified front for bargaining against political interference in their businesses.
They also ensure fair and even handling of apprenticeships, and oversee the relationship between wagoneers and local tradespeople and farmers.

#### Ruling Family

The local noble family is known as ‘Valley Storm’ In Commonwealth Standard, and have been Lords and leaders in Stormsword’s Rest for generations.
The city is named for the current Marchess’s grandfather, who was a skilled blacksmith and powerful campaigner.

The Marchess herself, *Xhosra Quillion-Durandal*, Stormsmaiden in common, is approximately 80 to 90 years of age, slightly older than her husband.
She is a local-born Drake; she descends from a clan whose Dragon progenitor was serpentine in gross layout, and winged.
Her family history is somewhat muddled, but it has left her with a long tail and brilliant, midnight-blue plumage.
She has prominent wings, with dextrous fingers at the wrist joint, and flourishing into bright yellows and reds along the trailing edge.
It is held that some of her ancestors where prominent performers in the amphiteatre, and that this may be why she is also somewhat lean and small, at least by Drake standards, though also quick-witted, deft, and confident.
She also possesses a keen analytical mind, and unsurprisingly is a powerful stateswoman.

Her husband is a member of the Stormsword line, the General Chandra Durandal, known originally (if unflatteringly) as Pukescale due to his uncomfortable yellow-green scales (and his ancestry).
The Durandal line is a hybrid of several Clans, whose Dragon progenitors where swamp-swimmers and "death-walkers" from the East.
Though his ranks was originally a social title, received when he married the Marchess, he has since proved himself worthy of it.
He has been a highly effective campaigner, known for his powerful build, for the mighty golem limb on his left side, and for his mastery of Dragonshire sword-craft – he is considered perhaps the greatest master of the Wyrmblade in the  Dragonshire.
He is also notable for a surprising understanding of architecture and construction, and a talent for seigecraft.
(His manner is far more blunt than his wife's, and so negotiations are often left to her.)

The couple have several children: there is a daughter just coming into adulthood, Xoshara Quillion-Durandal, and twin sons.
Xoshara herself has dedicated herself to learning her father’s trade in combat, and learning swordsmanship to her fullest; also, much like her father, she is determined to earn her rank, and so has begun her career with the town guard, where she wears a simple uniform to downplay her social rank. The sons are encouraged to make friends and explore through the town, and are well known throughout the parks and market-squares.
All three are being tutored and educated by their parent’s staff.

#### Notable People

The staff of the Manoral family take advisory and leadership roles in the town. An accountant and treasury officer of the family and town as a whole, a herder who eschews the traditional garb and behaviour of his own people. He decorates his antlers in ribbons, and wears suitably commonwealth-style, though colourful and fine clothing. He works to teach the children in mathematics and natural philosphy, and serves as a personal assistant to the Marchess in matters of law and contract. His work in a coin mint earned him the name ‘Coinhammer’
The master of assassins, a master swordsman and former slave with a vast collection of swords. Dressed far more simply, but never unarmed. Named Silver in common; Mercurio is a dark-haired, and olive-skinned human. A gladiator of some reknown in the kingdoms of men, and bearer of an aged and worn gladius sword that was once an artefact of the cult of the one. He is steadfast in his dedication to the ruling family, though, and a favoured sparring partner of Chandra.
The local leader of the High Road is an older goblin woman. Living underground in the kobold sections of town, she makes her daily coin by working as a brewer. Having apprenticed under master brewers in the town proper, she works on making alchemical potions of all kinds of uses. She has a good relationship with the local criminal bodies from her ability to disguise acids and poisons as more legitimate and helpful mixtures. She calls herself WesternGate, as a reference to her position as a gateway to freedom for many slaves
ShackleKey the Gnoll is the head officer of the town guard. From his office in the tower in the centre of town, he administrates the town guards people, and works to obtain equipment and uniforms for those under his stewardship. Old for a gnoll, and covered in a patchwork of scars, his traditionalism occasionally clashes with the town council, and his dedication to law and order has him conflict with local underworld figures.
Tuskbreak is a refined, well-groomed orcish gentleman. He is reserved and quiet, bringing little attention to himself. Never seen without darkly-hued magesight glasses and simple, but refined linens. Earthy tones that blend almost into invisibility with how plain they are. He insists that his interests are legitimate, but his relationship with WesternGate and other para-legal and criminal groups imply something less than legal.
While not a resident of Stormsword’s Rest, Broken Axe is another Orc who frequents the settlement, as a personal guest of General Stormsword. A liason between Commonwealth and Orcish armies, and former seperatist leader. He is advanced in age, and has a great deal of knowledge and experience he willingly shares at the military academy. The two have a history of conflict. He dresses in the fashion of a pre-commonwealth orcish leader, wearing white hair and scars proudly.

#### Notable Locations

Naturally, the Manor in the centre of town is a prominent location. Sitting on the top of the slight rise in the township, it stands three stories tall, the first story’s walls made of smoothly worked stone, merging seamlessly into the walls of the tower it’s built into. The tower itself is nearly five floors tall, a prominent elevation that allows the flame at it’s top to be viewed and used for navigation through the mountain pass. A cellar with openings into the subterranean sections of the town is hewn into the earth and stone, used for storage and kitchens for the manor above. The ground floor is dominated by council chambers and administrative offices of the town.
Upstairs, the manor is divided much like any normal manor would be, the first floor serving as a meeting hall, with access to a large dining chamber and library and study for the Marchess’es use. The third floor has bedrooms and personal chambers, and then the attic where the family’s assistants find their own chambers. The tower serves as a guard’s barracks, as well as a seperated cellar used to house criminals and drunks brought in by the guardsmen. ShackleKey’s office is on the ground floor, as is much of the administrative space the guard needs. Storage for town guard equipment is further upstairs.
The town square is built on the main road through the town. In front of the gatehouse in the wall seperating the manor and it’s lush gardens from the rest of the town. It is surrounded by the workers’ union halls, and beyond those, the workshops and warehouses of the inner walls, wide streets allowing the easy transport of goods.
The university is an older attachment, built atop a retaining wall as tall as the inner circle of walls, it’s wide, planned grid of walkways and streets between stately and finely-worked buildings. A mountain path leads up the steep valley wall to the top of the valley lip, to find an observatory, built up deliberately to protect the vulnerable telescopes. The thin, treacherous path is difficult for elder lecturers to traverse, but telepresence magics allow them to teach astrology and astronomy in the early mornings.
A large university library and taxonomical collection allows for a wide body of reference for study, and proximity to the workshops in the town below means that metallurgy and geology can be studied and developed by students and natural philosophers alike. The university is somewhat limited in studies of theology, though it still offers such courses, it is more known for it’s physical and philosophical studies.
The military academy to the south is more developed on it’s own artificial landing. More recently constructed, to modern design and architecture. Theorycrafting and developing new magic and technological methods of warfare, while teaching the new generations of drake officers historic campaigns and allowing them to study and reference the generals of old.
On the far eastern edge of the town’s holdings, the very outer layer of orchards and farms, is the Stormsmaiden Stables, A prominent breeder and dealer of Dancing Hawks, administrated by the Marchess herself as a business interest and investment. Known for supplying Hawks to the commonwealth military, the stables are large and well appointed, with a variety of harsh, rocky and uneven terrains for the hawks to mimic, as much as possible, their native terrain. There is a small population of prey animals for the hawks to naturally chase and attack, encouraging play and natural activity.
In the town proper, in a tangle of buildings and alleyways, is a suprisingly large inn. A bustling set of detached rooms behind a small garden nearly built-over by it’s neighbours. It’s often busy, and notably never visited by the town guard, except in the most dire of situations. It is kept clean, well-maintained. Colourful decorations and brightly painted tables and cups. It’s relatively safe, thanks to the watchful eye of the [northern pass crime family], and is a guaranteed place to reach their representative in town. The Burrow is also open for business to house adventurers and travellers, if they find the place. But more reputable inns dot the market square and town square.

#### Local Spirits

Likely the most notable local Spirit, and certainly the most bizarre, is Child-Of-The-Fallen-Star.
The spirit is of roughly humanoid appearance, but confusing nature.
Its features are elongated and stretched, far out of Human proportion, with its digits being particularly long and thick; it also lacks a nose and ears.
Despite its presumed deafness and alien nature, it has a quick wit and keen, almost preternatural insight; and its subtle and inhuman expressions betray a vast, alien intelligence.
It is a patron of knowledge and exploration: it is propitiated by the people of the city learning new lessons, methods, and sciences; it encourages learning, effort, and investigation; and it often whispers of discoveries yet to come.
It will say almost nothing of its origin; it is noted that it frequents the university and its attached observatory, although it doesn't seem terribly focused on any particular science.

The Brothers are sibling spirits whose Bassins are the two main mountain peaks to the north and south of the pass, with each spirit being tied to a particular peak.
There is a strong sibling rivalry between them, over whose mountain is the greater; they throw rocks and cause landslides down the slopes of their respective mountain, in order to widen the bases and make their realms appear larger.
They are celebrated yearly in a festival that merely asks them to be careful, and not destroy the township between them, or block the road.

Howl-of-The-Earth is a spirit of the winds that carry through the valley.
They are a gracious spirit, associated with safe travel; they often help those who propitiate them by providing guidance through the narrow, winding pass, and have been known to lead rescue parties through the pass to those who have met trouble.
They are also thought to bring good luck, especially in winter; in particular, shephards in the highlands around the town also make offerings to them, hoping for advanced warnings of threats and favorable weather.

#### Neighbours

Drahrat have been seen frequenting the town. There are no known drahrat caverns broaching the Northland Corridor, but this is not unusual for the secretive deep-explorer dwarves.
The Northland Corridor leads to what can be considered almost a ‘sister’ city on the orcish end of the Corridor. They have their own undying flame, and the halfway point of the Corridor can see both flames from a prominence off to one side of the path, aiding in navigation.
To the east, the Dragonshire stretches out, with smaller farming villages tens of demarc along the roads. More fertile, softer ground allowing more variety of farmed plants, feeding Stormsword’s Rest with both food, and plant matter for brewing into potions and alcohol. A large proportion of these villages are populated by Gnolls and Drakes.
[Further neighbours and relationships to be decided]

### Major Spirit: The Bullrush God

**Basin:** Unknown.  It was able to manipulate Dragon eggs to create the Drakes, and it apparently has use of land and a title.

**Manifestation:** Unknown, as it almost never manifests.  It appeared to Karrach in the form of a Drake.

**Propitiation:** Unknown, as it almost never seeks or accepts offerings.  The price it asked of Karrach was several *demarc* of marshland and a noble title.

**Binds:** None known.

The spirit responsible for the creation of the Drakes referred to itself with a number of names, among them *the Bulrush God*, *the Rainstorm Shepherd* and *the Osprey’s Father*.
After Karrach began searching for a spirit that would aid him in the creation of a *people*, the Bulrush God approached him in the form of a Drake; it offered him a people in that image, in exchange only for a stretch of swampland and a noble title.
Karrach met his price, and the Drakes were created.

It is unknown why the Bulrush God wanted to own a marsh — or why it cared if Karrach recognized that ownership, if that area had already been its Basin, as some claim; nor is there any obvious reason why a Great Spirit should want to also be a Count.
It is unknown if it has any wants, rituals, or binds; it is also unknown what its basin is, although it is clearly such that the Bullrush God could aid in the creation of the Drakes.
Since being granted its title and domain, it has sought no further contact with mortals, and has made no further desires known.

The Dragonshire zealously guards the territory granted to the Bulrush God, even though it did not specifically tell them to do so, out of concern for what it *might* do should its lands be invaded; when dealing with a spirit as powerful and mysterious as the Bulrush God, such precautions are wise.

## Northland Province

Northland Province consists of territories in the far north, on both the east and west of the Worldspine — the peaks of the Worldspine are lower in the extreme north of its range, so it poses less of a barrior.
It is the homeland of both the Orcs and Dwarves; notably, in both cases, some clans joined the Commonwealth, while others did not.

Kethanel is a city-state located on the island Kethel in the Ket Gulf, which separates Orcish and Dwarven lands west of the Worldspine.

Generations before the first Dwarven or Orcish holds joined the Commonwealth — some time around CY -100 — Kethel was settled roughly equally by Orcish and Dwarven clans, roughly six clans apiece.
The two clan-oriented cultures proved quite proved to be quite compatible, and where able to cooperate quite effectively.
Over the years, in the the tumult of Northland's clan politics, Kethel's occupants frequently found they had more common cause with those they shared their home with than with distant members of their own race.
In CY 213, the clans of Kethel Island held council: they agreed, first, to the authority of their council to make decisions for the island as a whole; second, formally, to an alliance of their clans; and third, to make peace with the Commonwealth, a new culture just extending its influence into the region.
Less than a century later, in CY 291, they signed the Commonwealth Charter.

Kethel Island is roughly circular, 43*dc* in diameter at its widest point.
Located in a northern gulf, the island's climate is slightly more moderate than the nearby coast, but still cold; the soil is also good, although rocky in places.

Kethanel is a city of more than thirty-five thousand situated in a wide bay on the island’s Southern edge.
The architecture of Kethanel is striking; the city is built both above and below ground, and is built of massive stones carved and set by both Orcish and Dwarven hands.
It is, not coincidentally, a veritable fortress.

Kethanel has long been a local trading and fishing hub, its role in trade is growing; though it has long been a port for boats crossing the gulf, as the Commonwealth’s sea-faring abilities improve, boats sailing up and around the coast from the Haven Isles have begun to make Kethanel a stopping-point.
Some have whispered that a Cairn may be built in Kethanel.

Though Kethel is still predominantly settled by equal numbers of Dwarves and Orcs, after the island joined the Commonwealth it saw an influx of more than a thousand Gnolls, mostly Snow-paws; they settled in the Southeastern reaches of the island.
More recently, Kethanel City has seen substantial Kobold immigration, and a small population of Ash Elven merchants have been carried to the city from the Haven Isles by boat.

## Westward Province

Westward Province is a narrow strip of heavily-fortified land running from the Worldspine to the east to the western coast.
It was the Commonwealth's original path to the coast, and to the Haven Isles.
It has seen constant raiding and incursion from the Shade Elves to the south, and has thus been heavily fortified — it is the most militarized and heavily-defended province of the Commonwealth, and includes some of its largest and most modern star-forts.

Seven-Points is a massive star-fort built in the center of Westward Province, where the province is at its narrowest, sandwiched between the rolling hills of Herd-and-Pack to the north and the Shade-elf-dominated steppes to the south.

The massive star-fort is at the cutting edge of fortification design, designed to provide optimal fields-of-fire for modern cannons, and to resist the Shade Elves' most sophisticated and modern tactics and weapons.
The fort is also massive, dwarfing a great many cities in scale; it hosts a permanent population and civilian support personnel, and has even granted charters to a handful of manors that have planted fields to the north.
In spite of its massive size and population, it is still provisioned for more than two years' of siege.

It is not the capital of Westward only because it technically is not a city; it is the center of Commonwealth military operations in the West.


Seven Points has a Kairne Circle.

The site has not gone 5 full years without combat since construction of the modern fortress began sixty-five years ago.

### Major Location: Sail-Forest

[[abstract]]
|
|Sail-Forest is the Commonwealth's greatest port-city on the West coast.
|Like Seven-Points (and much of Westward), it is as much a fortification as it is a city.
|The site is several hundred years old, and has grown outward in stages: the oldest district at the center was constructed in CY 424, in an older, more Eastern style; it is surrounded by stages of expansion, ringed by newer and ever more formidable walls.
|Besides being a busy port-city, it is connected to two major military installations: a formidable star-fort sits half a demarc to the north and inland, connected by a narrow, armored access-way, while Commonwealth Fleetyard Westward sits immediately to the south, within the outer-most ring of walls.
|Commonwealth Fleetyard Westward is second only to Southarbor and the Fortress Island as a naval installation, and constructs, hosts and commands the fleets that patrol the gulf between Islandhome and Westward.

## Herd-and-Pack Province

Herd-and-Pack Province sits in a stretch of patchy forests and rising hills north of Westward Province; it consists of the territory of the former Herd-and-Pack Alliance, an alliance principally between several Herder and Gnoll tribes to resist the Shade Elves.
Owing to a common enemy, the Herd-and-Pack Alliance had been allies of the Commonwealth since the latter first built settlements near the rolling steppe and praire of the west; with the Compact, the Alliance joined the Commonwealth as a province.
Though they meet all their obligations under the Compact, Herd-and-Pack remains somewhat insular; they largely practice their own traditional ways of life, and have showe less interest in trade and exchange with the larger Commonwealth.

[[abstract]]
|
|Five Rivers is situated on the top of a prominent hill 6 *demarc* west of the rough center of Herd-and-Pack province, in the rolling hills and small rivers of the center-west of the Emerald Plane.
|It was the Herder's oldest and greatest city, its construction predating the founding of Herd-and-Pack by almost two hundred years.
|Historically, it served as the de-facto capital of the Herd-and-Pack Alliance; today, it is the seat-of-administration for Herd-and-Pack Province.
|It's Commonwealth name is derived from the surrounding network of rivers that it commands; a rough transliteration of the Herder name is "*Kauhnahei*," which is believed to derive from the (fairly literal) phrase "Great Hill City."

## Haven Province

Haven Province consists of the Haven Isles, a large island chain off the western coast of the Emerald Plane.
Besides the original Human and Gnollish settlers from the Commonwealth, the Haven Isles have absorbed a large number of other populations: ratfolk refugees from the Warren Isles, Shade Elves from the inland praire, Dwarves from Northland, and Kobolds from the Eastern Kingdoms.
It is also the birthplace of the Ash Elves.
The Haven Isles are generally urban and cosmopolitan, and are something of a hot-bed of cultural exchange and political thought; in particular, they are known for the sophisticated administration and complex, federalized system of government.

### Common Language: Ashen

[[abstract]]
|
|Ashen is a (highly complex) language spoken primarily by Ash Elves.

|Group: HHED

|
|Special: Ashen is a difficult language to learn, imposing a -10 penalty on related checks.

Ashen is the highly complex language spoken by the Ash Elves of the Haven Isles.
It is a complex synthesis of several languages: while its earliest roots lie in Keillou (the language of the Shade Elves), it has since been influenced heavily by the (unrelated) languages of various Wood Elf and Shifter tribes, by Haven Weal, by Shipwright Hud, and even by Autumn Caravaneer.

On the one hand, Ashen is a very expressive language; it has access to a rich pallet of widely-varied elements.
On the other hand, it is *very* difficult to learn, being composed as it is of a half-dozen different languages.

### Common Language: Islander Skinned

[[abstract]]
|
|Islander Skinned is a derivative of several languages, principally based on Weal; it is slowly replacing regional variants of other languages as the first language for the Skinned — that is, furless — Folk of the Haven Isles.
|
|Group: HHED
|
|Partially Intelligeble: Haven Weal (-10), other Weal derivatives (-20), Keillou (-20), Hel (-20), Shipwright Hud (-30)

Islander Skinned is a language commonly spoken throughout the Haven Isles; it is distantly based on Haven Weal, but includes elements of many other languages.
The language is artificial; it is a formalized variant of Haven Weal, but also draws on many of the other languages of the Haven Isles, with the deliberate intent of creating a language that can be shared by the many "skinned" — that is, furless — folk of the Haven Isles.

As such, it is slowly displacing Shipwright Hud, Hel, Haven Weal, and several other languages as a frist language in the islands — although many of those peoples and cultures have hold-outs attempting to preserve their original languages.

While the language is a complex blend of many unrelated languages like Ashen, it is much easier to learn; it was very deliberately designed to be "regular" in its forms and easy to master.

### Common Language: Islander Furred

[[abstract]]
|
|Islander Furred is principally derived from Haven Gnollish, though it has been influenced by Cqik.
|Like Islander Skinned, it is designed to be shared by the "furred" racees of the Haven Isles, and is slowly replacing their other languages as the primary language of the "furred folk" of the Haven Isles.
|
|Group: GR
|
|Partially Intelligeble: Haven Gnollish, Cqik (-10), other derivatives of Gnollish and Cqik (-20)

Much as Islander Skinned, Islander Furred is a formalized, artificial language designed to unite several distinct communities in the Haven Isles, each with their own language.
Islander Furred is primarily based on Haven Gnollish, though it also borrows from Cqik; like Islander Skinned, it has also been simplified and made more regular, to make it easier to learn and master.

It is slowly displacing Haven Gnollish and Cqik a sa first language among the Gnolls and Ratfolk (respectively) of the HAven Isles — although, again like Islander Skinned, each community has its traditionalists and hold-outs.

### Major City: Union

[[abstract]]
|
|In Haven Isles style, Union is technically an "administrative region" consisting of three conjoined subterranean cities sharing a common central cavern, built under the peaks of Islandhome (the largest of the Haven Isles).
|One city is Ash-Elven, one is Shipwright Dwarven, and one — the newest — is Kobold; in the center, connecting the three, sits a bustling "public square" cavern that is istelf larger than some small cities.
|Union is, in many ways, the cultural center of the Haven Isles, and the three cultures at its heart; it is, unsurprisingly, also the capital of Haven Isles.

|Caravans helped bind the early Commonwealth together, and where the carriers of its trade.
|Originally peopled by Halflings and Gnolls, other races and groups have taken to caravan culture.

### Common Language: Autumn Caravaneer

[[abstract]]
|
|A language commonly spoken by Halfling caravaneers.
|
|Group: HHED
|
|Partially Intelligeble: some other Halfling languages

Autumn Caravaneer is the language commonly used by Halfling caravaneers.
It is derived from an older language commonly spoken by Halflings in the region, but it has been heavily influenced by the language spoken by the people of Automn's Hold — Weal.

## Merchant Voyagers (Benath)

[[designnote]]
|
|The Merchant Voyagers are an example member-tribe — or, more exactly, society of member-tribes.
|Obviously, many other tribes have — and have not — signed the Charter and joined the Commonwealth.

[[abstract]]
|
|The Merchant Voyagers are a group of Wood Elf, Human, and Shifter tribes who herd and hunt in a patch of the unclaimed land west of the Worldspine.
|By CY 570, all of the Voyager-speaking tribes had signed the Charter, and where Commonwealth members; thoughout the last several centuries, the Voyagers, unlike many other tribes, have exchanged heavily with the wider Commonwealth.
|
|---
|
|Population: 2.5M
|
|Common Languages: Voyager (Benath)
|
|Common Races: Wood Elves, Humans, Shifters

The Merchant Voyagers consist of a group of Elven, Human, and Shifter tribes who herd and hunt in a patch of the tribal lands west of the Worldspine — that is, west of the Worldspine and northeast of Herd-and-Pack province.
Though several different races, these tribes share a language and culture — which they call Benath, which loosely means "traders."
(The name "Traders," transliterated to Commonwealth Standard, would not name *one* culture very well; instead, they where given the Common Name "Merchant Voyagers.")

[[designnote]]
|
| "Merchant Voyager" doesn't render very well in English.
| In Common, it's a contraction of "Merchant" and a suffix that connotes travel, exploration, or adventure — somewhat like "Trade-onaut".

The Merchant-Voyager tribes are semi-nomadic: they have constructed a number of small cities, where the young and old reside, surrounded by planted fields; however, most of the young and able-bodied travel as nomadic herders, hunters, and traders.
Merchant-Voyager culture encourages trade, study, openness, and a kind of *pragmatism* — a Benath word that often gets rendered to "practicality" or "pragmatism," but describes a realist, almost-consequentialist streak in their law and philosophy.
Being open, curious, and trade-minded, they welcomed early Commonwealth explorers and traders.
Finding the Commonwealth to be a fair and beneficial trade-parters, they where quick to seek closer relations; the first Merchant-Voyager tribe signed the Charter less than a decade after they where first encountered.

[[designnote]]
|
| How are Merchant Voyageres different from the Herd-and-Pack Province?
| Herd-and-Pack is a *province*, because its people assembled an alliance that ruled a territory.
| By contrast, the Merchant Voyagers are semi-nomadic, ranging over a territory that they shared with other tribal cultures.
| They also didn't form an alliance; though they share a culture and language — and typically view themselves as members of a shared culture, and cooperate with one-another — they never formed a permanent alliance or shared government.

While many Merchant Voyagers have remained in their traditional lands and continue to practice their traditional lifestyles, with each generation, some portion of them leave to travel the wider Commonwealth.
Small Merchant Voyager enclaves can be found throughout Westward, Heartland, and Haven Provinces — in fact, much of the Wood Elf blood in Ash Elves comes from early Merchant Voyagers who settled on Islandhome (who also inherited a portion of the Merchant Voyagers' open and materialist outlook).

### Major City: Shifter's Market

[[abstract]]
|
|Shifter's Market is a typical Merchant Voyager city — if slightly larger than most.
|It is well and literally named; it consists of a few artisan-districts and market sqaures, surrounded by campgrounds.
|
|---
|
|Population: 13K
|
|Common Languages: Merchant Voyager
|
|Common Races: Shifters (70%), Wood Elves (10), Humans (10%)
|
|Location: tribal lands west of the Worldspine, northeast of Herd-and-Pack
|
|Industries: Trade, Tanning, Carpentry, Brewing, Agriculture

Shifter's Market is typical of Merchant-Voyager cities, if somewhat larger than most, constructed by a Shifter tribe of Merchant Voyagers.

At the center of Shifter's Market, there are a number of irregular districts, each laid out in a rough grid, branching off of the city's two main streets — one running roughly north-south, and the other roughly east-west.
Districts include homes for local farmers; market-squares surrounded by trader's homes; administrators; and artisens.
These distracts are space-out, and the ground between them is open; they are surrounded by the low Inner Wall.

The space between the inner and outer walls is open; it is used to house any of the tribe's nomadic herders, hunters, and traders who return home, as well as any visiting traders and caravans.
Surrounding this large open space is the larger Outer Wall, a thick structure of hewn-stone some six strides high and an impressive twenty strides thick.
(The outer walls where constructed in stages, as the existing walls where modernized and reinforced; it took generations to arrive at the current construction.)

### Common Language: Voyager (Benath)

[[abstract]]

|
|Partially Intelligeble: the native languages of other nearby tribes, Ashen (-20), Islander Skinned (-20)

The Merchant Voyagers speak their own language.
It's similar to the languages spoken by other nearby tribes, but dissimilar from any other language in the wider Commonwealth.
It's had a particularly strong influence on Ashen and Islander Skinned, since a number of Merchant Voyagers have settled in the Haven Isles (and since many Ash Elves are, in part, descendants of Merchant Voyagers).

## The Clay Men

|
|The Clay Men are one of the most unusual races in the Commonwealth, with one of the most unusual cultures: |they are extremely long-lived and very few in number; live deep underground, in far-isolated and well-fortified caverns; they do not farm, as they require little food; much of their cities are lightless, as they are blind; and they know more of the Leapers and Deep Explorer than any other race.

## Crossroads

|The joined cities of *Perseverance* (above ground) and *Triumph* (below).
|Together they form the City-Province of Crossroads, the largest and wealthiest city in the known world.

Crossroads is situated in a pass in the middle of the Worldspine, which connects Heartland and Westward provinces.
Crossroads consists of two "joined" cities, one above-ground and one below.
Perseverance developed from a travellers-rest founded in the past during the Commonwealth's westward expansion more than 700 years ago, and its present construction is much like the large City-Centers of Heartland province.
Beneath Perseverance is Triumph, a massive underground city constructed by the Kobold refugees and their descendants starting in CY 635.

### The Origin of Perseverance

Perseverance developed from a traveller's-rest constructed in the midst of the largest pass through the central Worldspine.
As traffic through the pass increased, it was expanded to include a few permanent structures — an inn, a market, a few houses, and later, a garrison.
It eventually grew into a major trade-post.
A rock-fall in CY 197 destroyed several of the older buildings; the city was rebuilt, in a larger and more modern style, between then and CY 201.
Perseverance has continued to prosper; as the Commonwealth spread west, as a swath of land west of the Worldspine was incorporated into the commonwealth, and especially as the Haven Isles where settled, trade through the Worldspine has only increased — and with it, the prosperity of Perseverance.

Even so, feeding and watering a city in the midst of a mountain pass is difficult, and this has limited how large Perseverance could become.

### The Origin of Triumph

Triumph is a massive underground city constructed by Kobold refugees starting in CY 635.
In CY 611, the Eastern Kingdoms began a horrific purge of the Kobold populations within their borders; this produced a massive Kobold exodus.
While significant numbers of Kobolds settled in the Dragonshire and Heartland, many more continued west.
Upon reaching the Worldspine, thousands of them elected to stop in Perseverance and build burrows in the surrounding area, rather than continuing on through the pass into Westward Province (and coming within reach of the Shaded Sea).
The Kobold population grew and prospered; the children of the refugees who settled around Perseverance where apprenticed to the tradespeople of the city, where they learned modern crafts — including the Commonwealth's sophisticated masonry.
As their community became skilled and wealthy — and as their numbers rapidly grew — they felt the need for a larger city.
In CY 629, the Kobold warrens came together, pooled their resources, and began to plan; in CY 635 excavation began.

### Perseverance and Triumph Today

Today, Perseverance is a walled city built in the center of a mountain pass running east-west through the central Worldspine.
The pass is walled on either end, with massive gates in the center of the walls.

Westward Way is a massive, open market that runs through the center of the town, from one wall to the other; it is wide and cobbled, with travellers' riding down the center while crowds peruse the many businesses along its length.
In the center of the city sits Crossroads Plaza, a circular plaza where Westward Way opens wide enough that it touches the opposite walls of the narrow valley — almost 500 strides across.
The Plaza is the busiest stretch of the 'Way: it's ringed with inns, public houses, restaurants, shops, traders' stalls, and workshops; and it's filled with a diverse sampling of the races and peoples of the world on their way through the Worldspine.
In the center is the Spiral Way, a massive, twinned-spiral ramp that descends into the depths, leading to Perseverance below; the two entrances wrap around a great fountain, and are surrounded on the outside by a small sculpture garden and reflecting pools.

High, cold and dry, the city has had to deal with both earthquake and fire over the centuries.
The city makes heavy use of iron, stone and brick in its construction, and minimizes the use of wood, plaster and paint.
Building are also built low, and buttressed despite their low stature; arches are heavily reinforced, and carefully designed to endure shifting, shaking, lateral stress and fire.
The city also contains a number of open stone paths, high stone walls, and carefully-placed water-courses and sewers, all designed to make fires easier to fight and contain.
The city commonly uses statues and tile mosaic for decoration — the better to survive wear and disaster.

Triumph is located almost 800 strides beneath Perseverance.
It sits in a massive, roughly circular artificial cavern about 65 strides high and almost a third of a demarc across \[about 1.3km\].
The city was founded by Kobolds, and they remain a majority of the population — but they have opened their city to all, and the city has populations of countless other races and peoples.
Kobold culture in the East was highly social and communal, centering around burrows occupied by extended families; these traditions and values shaped how the Kobolds built their great city.
Triumph is broken into an irregular grid of city-blocks, each of which is built around a central spire; the spire both supports the rough high above, and has conduits that serve to carry air and water from the surface into the city.
Homes and work-spaces surround the central spires.
The culture of the Kobolds of triumph remains highly familial and communal; private spaces — ranging from private rooms in homes and private homes in city-blocks — tend to be small, and shared and public spaces tend to be large.
A block's public spaces — and especially their spires — are a point of pride; they are often masterfully and arfutlly carved, lavishly decorated, and kept immaculately clean and in excellent repair.
Spires are often decorated with elaborate carvings and sculpture.

A tough mass of granite forced the city's excavators to dig the north half lower than the south, which has resulted in the modern city consisting of a *low side* to the north and a *high side* to the south.
The floor of the lower side is 6sd lower than the south, while the ceiling is 12sd lower — and consists of the largely unfinished mass of iron and stone they had to tunnel beneath.
The low side is smaller than the southern one, as the division between the two is north of the center of the city, and the outer edge of the low side is irregular and hemmed in by tough stone.
The low side is lowest near the terrace (described below), and slopes slightly up to the north; the high side is highest at the terrace, and slopes slightly down to the south.

The low side contains many of city's public buildings: it contains the city-seat, the court-house, two of the city's five libraries, two of its four theatres — including the great Ampitheater of the Orator at the Crossroads, the second-largest theatre in the known world — and the city's garrison.
The high side contains more of the city's markets, including the Market of the Well, a market that surrounds the heavily-fortified well-and-cistern to the south of the Spiral Way.
The boundary between the two consists of a wall and balcony that runs from east to west, roughly a city-block to the north of the lower terminus of the Spiral Way in the center of the city.
An great pavilion runs along the top of this balcony, while the lower part is faced with building-fronts broken by arcades and public squares.

The name *Crossroads* for the twinned cities is literal; running at a slight angle from north-to-south is the Kobolds' Way, a great highway that runs through city and into the underground.
The Highway picks up immediately to the west of the Spiral Way; it is supported by a great colonnade as it runs to the north over the *low side*, and by terraced berms to the south, where it passes slightly uphill while the rest of the High-Side slopes down beneath it.

The city also contains the Triumph Gallery, a great gallery situated around the Spiral Way at the top of the cavern.
The Spiral Gallery has low walls — to ensure that the small Kobolds can see over its walls — but uses closely-placed wrought-iron bars to preserve the safety of viewers.
The Spiral Gallery provides a stunning view of one of the most breathtaking sights in the Commonwealth.
The Spiral Way itself provides an impressive view: its outer walls are solid, to preserve the safety of travellers, but it has closely-spaced narrow windows to provide a frequent view onto the stunning city.

### The Garrison

Crossroads has two great garrisons.
One is in Low-Side of the city of Triumph below, and one is built outside of the western wall of the city of Perseverance above.
The Perseverance Garrison is the larger of the two — both because incursion from the west has historically been the greater danger, and to reduce the amount of air that needs to be channelled into Triumph.

Perseverance's outer walls have suffered more damage from weathering, fire and earthquake than they have from invading armies; they have long been built for durability and low-maintenance more than they have to repulse attackers.
Perseverance Garrison sits between Perseverance's western wall, and its own massive Garrison Wall — a much heavier fortification designed to repulse a potential invasion from the Shaded Sea.

### Governance

Each city has its own government; they also have combined representation on the Commonwealth Council as Crossroads.

Perseverance is run by a City Council.
It has 25 seats: 2 are the Guild's Seats, held by the local Trader's Guild that first took responsibility for maintaining the trader's-rest that developed into Triumph; 3 are the Oligarch's Seats, each one held by a prominent local family; and 20 are the Elected Seats, popularly elected by the occupants of the city.

Elections in Perseverance are complicated.
Each seat corresponds to a certain portion of the city, but many also allow certain outsiders to vote in the district; for example, the Gnolls' District consists of several city-blocks on the eastern edge of the city with a large Gnollish population, and the district also allows any Gnoll living anywhere else in the city to vote for their council seat.
This means that councilors may compete for votes throughout the city, rather than just in their district.

## Fortress Island

[[abstract]]

|Fortress Island is the Commonwealth's promise to the Raptor Protectorate, and a threat to the Shaded Sea and the Goblin Empire.
|It is built on one of the Trio Islands in the Jade sea (the other two being claimed by Foam-and-Cloud).
|Originally planned to be a single star-fort on a large island in the Jade Sea, a series of smaller "flanking" fortifications, support installations, temporary outposts and civilian settlements have been built.
|Today, it is a massive, sprawling web of fortifications, outposts, and walled manors built into the low coast of the island, hosting a large permanent population, a massive Commonwealth garrison, and a formidable fleet — and it is still far from finished.
