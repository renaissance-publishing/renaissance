# Combat Items

In general, we try to keep items and inventories fairly abstract; we break items into five broad cost-categories, and most things are purchased as part of a skill kit.
However, we do have a wide variety of listed combat items, with a diverse list of tags; this is because such items are often central to combat characters, and their players frequently enjoy getting to add detail to their characters.

## Armors

The following listings are for common types of armor.
Each entry is for a full *suit* or *set* of the given armor type (that is, helmets, gauntlets and grieves are not purchased separately).
(The list also contains some related garments that provide AV or other useful features.)

Armor is often heavy and cumbersome, and it is not normally possible to wear more than one suit of armor at a time.
**Layerable** armors are an exception: they can be worn under (or sometimes over) other armors to provide an additional benefit.
Besides your primary armor, you can wear a second set of armor under or over it, but only if the second set has the layerable tag.

Most people only wear armor if they are either going into battle or are performing some ceremonial role; wearing armor while eating, attending a reception, doing business, or otherwise going about your business would be considered extremely unusual at best (which might impose penalties to social skills checks, and would make it nearly impossible to blend into a crowd), and might be interpreted as a threat at worst.
**Sociable** armors are an exception; either because they are accepted as normal attire in some cultures, or because they are not obvious as armor, they can be worn in social situations without seeming strange.
(The **Sociable** tag is potentially dependant on the culture and situation; in some situations, the GM may declare that it does not apply.)

Some armors provide protection at the cost of impairing movement, whether by virtue of being heavy, or rigid, or awkwardly placed; these armors have the **Cumbersome** tag.
(The exact penalty or penalties will be listed separately.)

Most armors are assumed to represent a complete suit of armor of a consistent construction — for example, a whole suit of plate, including helmets, gauntlets and grieves, or an entire coat of mail, covering a user to the thigh and including sleeves.
Some armor, however, consist of different components, such as pairing plate at the arms and legs with a brigandine chest-piece.
These armors have the **Composite** tag.

Most armors cover most of the wearer’s body, including their head and extremities.
Some armor, however, leaves large portions of the wearer exposed; these armors have the **Exposed** tag.
Armors with the *exposed* tag are particularly vulnerable to those attempting to *strike an armor gap* (see the maneuver, in *Combat*), and may impose other penalties as well (listed separately.)

Some armor (and other outfits) are particularly good at concealing their wearer.
Armor with the **Stealthy** tag provides the wearer with a +10 bonus to Stealth checks.

Similarly, some armors (and other garments) obscure the wearer, making it difficult to identify them.
Armor with the **Concealing** tag provides the wearer with a +10 bonus when attempting to blend into a crowd.
They also make it impossible to detect items concealed with Slight of Hand, and impose a -30 penalty on Read checks made against the wearer.
(These bonuses only apply to casual inspection — such as passing a character in a crowd.
They do not apply to detailed inspection — such as if a character is being searched.)

Some armor is especially visible, ostentatious, or prominent; this is often true of armors that have a ritual or ceremonial role, armors that prominently bear the insignia of some clan or organization, or armors that are commonly worn during competition.
These armors have the **Proud** tag.
Armor with the *Proud* tag can provide bonuses or penalties in social situations, depending on the associations that other characters have with the armor or its insignia; this is at the GM's discretion.
In combat, opponents may view a character wearing *Proud* armor as particularly prominent or threatening, and thus be more likely to focus on that character.

### Quilted Armor

A doublet or jacket consisting of layering material around thick wadding
in order to protect the wielder from impacts. An outer layer of dense
cotton weave or cured leather also protect the wearer from cuts and
scrapes. They are considered normal outer wear for the nobility of both
the Kingdoms of Men and the Dragonshire, and for guards and soldiers
deployed in cities.

Armor Value: 2 AV

Drawbacks: None

Tags: Layerable, Sociable

### Leather Armor

Boiled, hardened leather worn as a light plate. It is easily darkened
for use in the shadows, and is light enough to not require any special
training or impair the wearer's mobility. It lacks the protective
capacity of heavier armors, though.

Armor Value: 4 AV

Drawbacks: None

Tags: Stealthy

### Mail Armor

A flexible covering of metal made of interlocking rings, mail armor has been in use in one form or another for more than 800 years.
Mail is relatively quick to weave and manufacture from the proper wire stock, so it is effective at stretching limited supplies of metal.
It's flexibility makes it easy to wear, and it means that it can be made large enough to cover most of the wearer's body without limiting mobility or requiring careful fitting and manufacture; however, mail hangs very heavily from the wearer, which impedes useful mobility in its own way.
Mail is also relatively bad at distributing impacts, and resisting modern arrowheads and lances; for this reason, those who can afford to do so are shifting to plated armors.

Armor Value: 5 AV

Drawbacks: -5 to checks that include your COO

Tags: Cumbersome, Heavy

### Mail Armor Rev

A flexible covering of metal made of interlocking rings, mail armor has been in use in one form or another for more than 800 years.
Mail is relatively quick to weave and manufacture from the proper wire stock, so it is effective at stretching limited supplies of metal.
It's flexibility makes it easy to wear, and it means that it can be made large enough to cover most of the wearer's body without limiting mobility or requiring careful fitting and manufacture; however, mail hangs very heavily from the wearer, which impedes useful mobility in its own way.
Mail is also relatively bad at distributing impacts, and resisting modern arrowheads and lances; for this reason, those who can afford to do so are shifting to plated armors.

Armor Value: 6 AV

Drawbacks: -5 to checks that include your COO

Tags: Cumbersome, Heavy, Vulnerable: Impact (-2 AV), Vulnerable: Piercing (-3 AV)

### Brigandine

*Brigandine armor is representative of a wide variety of "intermediate" armors based on the composition of many smaller plates with other materials, like layers of mail, leather, or plate.*
*This entry can be adapted to produce lamellar armor, laminar armors, a coat-of-plates, or other broadly similar armors.*

Brigandine armor is one among several varieties of armors that make use of *metal plates* to improve protection.
Brigandine armor consists of small, oblong metal plates riveted to the outside of a leather garment.
Brigandine armor provides improved protection over mail, while being cheap and easy to produce — although it still requires access to good-quality steel plates, and the highest-quality armors still require those plates to be fitted to the wearer.

Brigandine armor is in wide use in the Commonwealth.
It became the standard armor for the Commonwealth's armies more than 180 years ago; only within the last 30 years as the Commonwealth begun to replace brigandine armor with solid plate even for its common soldiery.

- Armor Value: 7 armor
- Drawbacks: -10 to checks that include your COO.
- Tags: Composite, Cumbersome, Heavy

### Raider's Armor

*Raider's armor is an example variant armor, based on Brigandine armor.*
*It is similar to Brigandine, but is easier to manufacture — especially if you're scavenging components.*
*It is commonly worn by Shade Elven raiders.*

Raider's armor is a style of armor commonly worn by Shade Elves.
It has replaced iron mail jackets and coats as the Shade Elves' enemies have begun to use more powerful and effective weapons.

Raider's armor is, of course, designed for use by a mounted archer; it is built in the style of a heavy jacket, typically running down to the knee and covering the wearer's thighs, but split so that the wearer can ride a horse.
Raider's armor is multi-layered; it consists of metal plates, riveted to an outer layer of leather and covered on the inside by a layer of fabric.
(Silk is often used, as it's believed to better bind arrows as they strike, making them easier to remove.)
This armor allows the Shade Elves to make use of metal plates for armor, while still remaining relatively light, flexible, and easy to manufacture and wear.

The components can vary; the Shade Elves have poor access to steel, so the inner plates are often made of iron, cured leather, or even wood.
Shade Elves also often scrap captured Commonwealth steel armors to make Raider's armor; Commonwealth plates are often fitted to Gnollish or Drake wearers, which Shade Elves cannot conceivably wear, so these larger plates are cut into smaller pieces for use in raider's armor.
(One notable benefit of riveting the plates on the *inside* is that an attacker does not necessarily know how many plates are present, what their extent is, or what they are made of.)

- Armor Value: 4 AV (Wood or Leather), 7 AV (Iron or Steel)
- Drawbacks: -10 to checks that include your COO.
- Special: Medicine checks made to treat arrow wounds inflicted through Raider's Armor receive a +20 bonus.
- Tags: Composite, Cumbersome, Heavy

### Imperial Armor

*Imperial Armor is an example variant armor, based on Brigandine armor.*
*It requires more maintenance and is more difficult to make, but it provides good protection, and it travels better because it can be broken into segments which collapse on themselves.*
*It is commonly worn by the soldiers of the Goblin Empire.*

Imperial Armor is a distinctive style of armor worn by the soldiers of the Goblin Empire.
As much as an improvement in technology, it represents the rapid increase in wealth in the Goblin Empire and the strides the Empire has made in consolidating power under their banner.

The Second High Kingship of the Kingdom of Men took a toll on the Goblins; for centuries after, high-quality metal armors became a scarcity, as the relatively poor and unorganized Goblin Kingdoms outfitted their various troops with a range of armors, often of hide or light mail.
As the Goblin Empire has grown wealthy from the conquest of the Ruby Plane, metal armors have become more common — and as the Empire has slowly shifted power from the Goblin Kings and Warlords to its own bureaucracy, it has increasingly standardized the equipment and training of its troops.

Imperial armor is made out of a series of horizontal steel bands, overlapping at the bottom; these are attached to vertical strips of leather.
(These strap are thick, which lifts the steel plates slightly off the chest and back of the wearer; this is important to keep the plates from catching on the plates of the goblin's own bony segmented plates.)
The shoulders feature their own, larger plates, "sleeves" of smaller plates protect the arms (and, rarely, thighs).

The design of this armor allows the Empire to field steel plate armors, without requiring that a single solid plate be individually fitted to its wearer.
The armor also travels well, because it can be "collapsed"—where the plates stack over the top of each other.
The rows of plates typically do not meet along the sides under the arms, so it is also light and breaths relatively well — especially since Imperial troops usually do not wear layers of leather or cloth beneath it as the soldiers of the Kingdoms or Commonwealth do.

On the down-side, this armor also doesn't completely cover the wearer: it doesn't cover the legs or under-arms, and leaves plenty of prominent gaps.
This problem is mitigated in practice, because Imperial troops are normally issued large, curved shields, and they rely on these shields (and close formation) to provide primary defense.

- Armor Value: 7 AV
- Drawbacks: -5 to checks that include your COO.  This armor's AV is reduced by 2 if the attacker scores an Exceptional or Critical success.
- Tags: Cumbersome, Exposed, Heavy

### Partial Plate

Consisting of steel plates and leather straps, partial plate protects only parts of the wearer.
The typical layout will cover the throat, shoulders, arms and shins in plate, though other arrangements exist — including single plates directly over the heart and kidneys, or gladiator sleeves.

- Armor Value: 6 AV
- Drawbacks: This armor’s AV is reduced by 3 if the attacker scores an Exceptional or Critical Success.
- Tags: Exposed, *Proud* (Optionally)

### Full Plate

A full set of plate armor is among the best protection available.
Coating the wearer's body in solid plates of refined steel, it is worn by the noble knights of the Dragonshire and Kingdoms of Men, and by the Commonwealth’s fearsome elite soldiers and shock troops.
Full plate can vary somewhat in quality and fitting; while the plates can be heavy, well-fitted armors little impairs gross agility or strength.

- Armor Value: 10 AV
- Drawbacks: -10 to checks that include your COO, -2 INIT
- Tags: Concealing, Cumbersome, Heavy, Proud

Special: *Well-fitted* full plate is also available.
This armor has only a -5 penalty to COO-linked checks, and no INIT penalty.
It is, however, Cost: Major.

### Heavy Cloak

Outerwear made of heavy, dense material, commonly worn by travelers and soldiers alike.
Some are emblazoned with badges of office, crests, or other symbols of power and prestige; others are made in muted colors, designed to make the wearer inconspicuous.

- Armour Value: 1 AV
- Drawbacks: None
- Special: Heavy Cloaks are Cost: Minor
- Tags: Concealing, Layerable, *Proud* (Optionally), Sociable, *Stealthy* (Optionally)

### Stealth Suit

- **Cost**: \[Minor\]

Individuals and cultures throughout the known world have developed outfits designed for stealth, from webbing fastened with leaves and foliage to simple dark clothing.

- Armor Value: 0 AV
- Drawbacks: None
- Tags: Concealing, Layerable, Stealthy

## Shields

Many different types of shields are in use throughout the nations and cultures of Emerals and Ruby Planes; only a few of them are listed here.

### Buckler

A punch or buckler is a small metal disc or cone held wielded over the knuckles and hand of the users off-hand;
it is usually held with a horizontal bar passing directly behind the center of the shield.
The buckler provides little cover to the user, but does benefit those who rely on parrying to deflect incoming attacks.

Armour: 1

Tags: Exposed, Off-hand, Parry

### Swordbreaker

A swordbreaker is a dagger or short-sword intended primarily for defensive use.
Though they don't have much of an edge, the back of the blade features a ``comb'' of raised and lowered points.
A tool of the dishonorable, it is used by swordsmen to trap and hold their opponent's sword, leaving them open to attack.

Armour: 0

Tags: Off-hand, Trapping Parry, Dishonorable

### Targe

A *targe* is a round, wooden shield with a metal boss in the centre and a metal rim;
they are often painted in prominent colours and patterns.
The smallest, lightest shield available that can protect its user even when hung out of hand, it's still light enough to wield in melee and be used to deflect an enemy's blows.

Armour: 2

Tags: Off-hand, Parry, Cavalry

### Kite shield

Kite shields are made entirely of metal, and are commonly wielded by elite fighters in cultures capable of producing high-quality steel at scale — and thus they are commonly seen wielded by knights.
Kite shields cover a wielder from shoulder to thigh, and are usually about as wide as the wielder's chest.
They are useful for the mix of mobility and cover that they provide; they are often used to block incoming arrows and crossbow bolts, allowing heavily-armored combatants to close effectively.

Heater shields are similar in function, though they are wider and not quite as tall;
heater shields are in ubiquitous use in both the Kingdoms of Men and the Commonwealth's military.

Armour: 3

Drawback: -5 COO-linked skills

Tags: Off-hand, Cavalry, Heavy

### Tower Shield

Tower shields are enormous, covering the user from head to knee.
The largest shields in common use by single fighters, tower shields also provide cover for the ranks behind them, as well as an impassible wall to opponents in front.

Some armies deploy these shields in formation, where they can be powerful defensive weapons;
tower shields in the front ranks can cover pikeman in rear ranks, creating a powerful formation — if one that is vulnerable to being flanked.
Many Dwarven holds use tower shields in the defense of their holds; there, they allow them to nearly completely block off the narrow hallways and irregular stone tunnels of their homes.
Some Gnollish families in Northland Province have also developed a fighting style that centers on the use of a tower shield; the style is notably different from the one used by their Dwarven neighbors, and focuses on maximizing the defense provided by the shield in melee combat.

Armour: 4

Drawback: -10 COO-linked skills

Tags: Off-hand, Heavy

### Archer's Shield

The Archer's Shield is a massive shield designed for use by formations of archers, crossbows, or hand-cannons.
These massive shields can completely cover the wielder, and are equipped with a spike that can be driven into the ground.
While the offer impressive defenses, they are not particularly  mobile.

- Armor: 5
- Drawback: -15 COO-linked skills
- Special: Cover
  - Archer's shields provide *partial cover* to their users against most attacks.
- Special: Planting
  - Archers' shields can be *planted* in suitable ground — that is, ground that can be penetrated by the spike (so, for example, archer's shields cannot be planted on rocks).
  - *Planting* or *uprooting* and archer's shield is a *quick action*.
  - While planted, the shield is effectively immobile; if the user wishes to move, they must either *uproot* the shield or abandon it.
  - While planted, the penalty to COO-linked skills is reduced to -5, and the *Cumbersome* tag is negated.
- Special: Fire-Port
  - Archer's shields intended for use with crossbows and hand-cannons are often fitted with braces and small openings, allowing a crossbow or hand-cannon to be braced against the shield (as described in *Cover* in *Combat*).
- Tags: Off-hand, Heavy, Cumbersome, *Plantable*, *Cover*

## Weapons

The following is a sampling of the weapons in use throughout the world.
It is by no means complete; GMs and players should feel free to create
whatever specific weapons they desire by starting with a similar weapon
from the list and making changes as necessary.

Some weapons can be used **One-Handed**, while others require a
**Two-Handed** grip; still others are worn rather than held (and this
have the **No-Handed** tag).

Some weapons are particularly good at parrying, guarding or deflecting
attacks; these weapons have the **Defensive** tag. When you use such a
weapon to defend yourself, you gain a +10 bonus. Conversely, some
weapons may be awkward, clumsy or fragile — or, in the case of ranged
weapons, may not be designed to *strike* an opponent at all — and thus it
is very awkward to defend yourself while carrying them; these weapons
have the **Vulnerable** tag. You take a -10 penalty to your defense when
wielding such a weapon.

Similar to Vulnerability, some weapons, though they may be effective,
hinder your ability to move about; these weapons have the **Awkward**
tag. Awkward weapons impose a -10 penalty to *movement skills* while you
are wielding them.

Some weapons, commonly pole-arms, have a particularly long reach, which
provides a notable advantage; these weapons have the **Reach** tag.
Reach weapons can attack an opponent who is 1m further away (that is, if
you are using a combat grid with 1m sqaures, then you can attack people
who are 1 square away). Reach weapons also do not suffer a penalty for
attacking a mounted character.

Some weapons are particularly good at preventing an opponent from
closing; these weapons have the **Fend** tag. If you have such a weapon
and an opponent comes within reach of you, you can make an *attack of
opportunity* against them (normally, you could only make an attack of
opportunity if they attempted to move away from or past you.) This uses
all the normal rules for an attack-of-opportunity, including counting as
a reaction.

Some weapons can be braced, and used to receive a charge; these weapons
have the **Brace** tag. See *Charging* in *Combat* for the rules for
bracing to receive a charge.

Some weapons are particularly easy to use; these weapons have the
**Easy** tag. Such weapons receive a +10 bonus on attack checks.
Conversely, some weapons are very *difficult* to use; they have the
**Difficult** tag, and receive a -10 penalty on attack checks.

Some weapons are well-suited to a particular combat maneuver; these
weapons have the **Well-Suited** tag. The Well-Suited tag will always
include the specific maneuver that a weapon is used with, written as
“Well-Suited: Trip”. When using a well-suited weapon, you do not take
the listed penalty when attempting the given maneuver.

Many weapons are particularly difficult to use in confined spaces, where
drawing and swinging a weapon is difficult. Some weapons, however, can
be used effectively even when you have very little room to maneuver.
Weapons with the **Close** tag can be used in confined spaces without
penalty.

Weapons with the **Small** tag can also be used in confined spaces by
virtue of their size; however, they have other drawbacks, including
their lack of reach compared to other weapons (which imposes a -10
penalty to your attack and defense when fighting a character with a
reach advantage).

Most weapons are awkward (at best) to use while mounted; some, however,
make excellent mounted weapons. These weapons have the **cavalry** tag;
see *Mounted Combat* in *Combat* for details.

Some weapons are particularly able to bypass a defender’s guard; these
weapons have the **Bypass** tag, and impose a -20 penalty to the
defender’s defense.

This is the point where I ran out of energy. The ones that are left are:

  - Prone: this weapon can be used just as effectively while prone.
  - Loud: this weapon is very loud; it will be obvious to anyone in the
    area when it is used.
  - Single-Use: some weapons are designed to be used only once; after a
    single shot (if a ranged weapon) or single hit (if a melee weapon),
    the weapon becomes useless.
  - Soak: this weapon is particularly well-suited to delivering poisons.
  - Grip: this weapon improves grip while grappling. (Doesn’t this only
    possibly apply to the wraps?)
  - Secure: this weapon is very difficult to disarm.
  - … actually, it’s true in general that not every tag has to have a
    rule. Hmm.

Some of these should really be rewritten to just punt to the rules in
Combat. This includes at least Reach and Brace.

## No-Handed Weapons

No-handed weapons are typically *worn*, like clawed or spiked gauntlets.
Though they put a wielder at a disadvantage against someone with a
longer weapon (which will give their opponent and advantage in reach and
leverage), they do have the certain advantages — including that some of
them are not obvious as weapons.

### Hand Wraps

Wrapping a character's hands and/or feet in thin material to provide
better grip will benefit a grappler; some users might also soak the
materials in chemicals or toxins.

Tags: No-Handed, Soak, Grip, Concealable, Unarmed, Small

Damage: as unarmed strike

AP: as unarmed strike

Cost: Trivial

### Sapper Gloves

Sapper gloves are simple leather gloves that have had a heavier, stiffer
material (like lead or iron) sewn into the lining; this both provides a
stiffer impact point and protects the wearer’s hands.

Tags: No-Handed, Grip, Concealable, Unarmed, Small

Damage: As Unarmed Strike, +2

AP: As Unarmed Strike

Cost: Low

### War Gloves

Plated Gloves with individual fingers ending in bladed claws, with
spikes protruding from each knuckle. The spikes allow a wielder a
measure of armor-penetration, though they are more effective at slashing
and maiming. They were first deployed by goblins, but these simple
weapons have since spread widely.

Tags; No-handed, Bladed, Clumsy, Maiming, Small

Damage: As Unarmed Strike, +5

AP: As Unarmed Strike, +1

## One-Handed Weapons

One-handed weapons are simple to drill with, and allow a deal of
flexibility. A person with a one-handed weapon can use their free hand
to carry a shield, a second weapon, or activate devices like Torches or
levers. A single hand on the weapon means the wielder will lack the
leverage and raw power of a two-handed weapon, though certain one-handed
weapons can match the reach of polearms, or be thrown as ranged weapons.

### Knife

Knives are small, concealable weapons that come in a great variety of
designs and styles; the example here is a short blade with a single
edge. Some knives can be throw effectively. Many knives are not designed
primarily for use as weapons; they are commonly carried as utility items
by woodsman and craftsmen. Knives are commonly used by assassins and
criminals, so many knives feature channels on the blade that can hold
poisons, or hollowed handles that can be used to hold small items or
messages.

When thrown, knives use the normal range-brackets for a thrown object,
see Thrown Weapons in Combat.

Tags: One-handed, Off-Hand, Thrown, Bladed, Small, Soak, Utility, Close

Damage: 1d10-1+DB (one-handed and thrown)

AP: 1

### Dagger

A small blade similar to a knife, save that it is longer and double-edged, and thus more suited to thrusting.
Like knives, numerous cultures have developed variations on the dagger; purely ceremonial forms are common.
Daggers intended for combat are often carried as tertiary weapons, though some swordsmen may carry an off-hand dagger to assist in parrying and defense.

Notably, many Shade Elves practice an energetic and mobile fighting style that uses daggers; the style has been inherited (and modified) by Ash Elves as well.

Tags: One-handed, Off-hand, Bladed, Small, Soak, Defensive, Utility, Close

Damage: 1d10+1+DB

AP: 1

### Short Sword

A short sword is any sword of up to 75cm in length, with a short handle and large pommel.
Short swords are a classic military sidearm used by countless cultures throughout the Emerald Plane.
Though they are heavier, more difficult to wield and more expensive than other weapons of comparable length, they are also more versatile; they can be used to thrust and parry as well as slash, and so they can be used in tight quarters, can be used defensively and can be used to make very precise attacks.

Arming swords are a ubiquitous sidearm wielded by Commonwealth troops; they have a single edge, which comes to a sharpened point at the end; they are suitable for slashing and thrusting, and thanks in part to being single-edged they are cheap to produce in large numbers, even when manufactured at the high levels of quality for which the Commonwealth is known.

Tags: One-handed, Bladed, Cavalry, Close, Defensive, Well Suited: Called
Shot

Damage: 1d10+3+DB

AP: 1

### Long Sword

A long sword is a longer, heavier sword of up to 100cm. Long swords have longer handles, which allows for the use of a second hand for better leverage.
Though this allows the user to strike a powerful blow, the extra weight and length also makes the weapon awkward and difficult to use.

Tags: One-handed, Two-handed, Bladed, Heavy, Close, Defensive, Difficult

Damage: 1d10+4+DB (one-handed) 2d10+DB (two-handed)

AP: 2

### Orcish Sabre

Orcs traditionally use a sword and shield when fighting.
They commonly use a large sword with a single edge (because they are easier to produce in large numbers).
The tips are commonly sharpened to a point, so that they may be used for thrusting.

Tags: One-handed, Bladed, Cavalry, Close, Defensive, Well Suited: Maim

Damage: 1d10+3+DB, AP: 1

### Deep-Explorer's Knife

*This weapon is a variant weapon.  It is similar to the Longsword, but deals slightly more one-handed damage (and slightly less two-handed damage), and gains Well Suited: Mighty Blow (and soak) in echange for Poorly Suited: Strike Armor Gap.*

Many Deep-Explorers wield a characteristic sword designed for use from salamander-back in close quarters.
They are long, broad-bladed, have a single cutting edge and are weighted towards the far end.
Although the grip is slightly small for it, the Deep-Explorer's Knife can also be wielded in two hands for better leverage.

Tags: One-handed, Two-handed, Bladed, Close, Difficult, Heavy, Soak, Poorly Suited: Strike Armor Gap, Well Suited: Mighty Blow

Damage: 1d10+5+DB (one-handed), 2d10-1+DB (two-handed)

AP: 2

### Hatchet

A short axe designed as much for use as a tool as a weapon, the hatchet
is the definition of utility. They can be used to gather firewood and
kindling, to hammer tent pegs, as a thrown weapon (though the average
hatchet is poorly weighted for this), or as a close-range weapon to fend
off an enemy. Hatchets are singularly simple to use, their handles and
blades promoting good edge alignment by virtue of design.

Tags: One-handed, Thrown, Bladed, Blunt, Easy, Utility

Damage: 1d10-1+DB (one-handed and thrown)

AP: 1

### War Axe

A war axe is any axe of up to 60cm, with either a single or double head.
War axes are common weapons found throughout the cultures of the Emerald
Plane; most consist of a long, wooden heft with a single metal blade at
the end. They are common because they are easy and cheap to make,
because they are effective even when made with poor metal, and because
they require little training for a user to be minimally effective.
Because much of their length is wooden, axes are lighter and faster than
swords — though they also offer more force behind a blow, because they are
heavily weighted towards the head. For the same reason, they are
slightly more capable of defeating armor, thanks to focusing a greater
force on a smaller point of impact.

Goblins make particularly common use of war axes, owing to their lack of
access to high-quality steel. In recent years, some Goblin smiths have
begun to attach a hook, hammer-point or spike to the back of the weapon,
intended for use against armored targets.

Damage: 1d10+2+DB

AP: 3

### Club

A club is any arm’s-length blunt instrument used in combat — anything from
a discarded tree branch, to a rod of steel with all the trappings of a
sword, to an intricately-decorated ceremonial weapon. Perhaps
unsurprisingly, many of these weapons are particularly ineffective
against modern armor.

Tags: One-Handed, Easy, Blunt, Well Suited: Maim, Well Suited: Mighty Blow

Damage: 1d10+DB

AP: 0

### Mace

Maces combine the weighted head of an axe with the ease-of-use of a club.
Modern maces are designed to be simple to use and cheap to manufacture, while being more capable of defeating armor than clubs — though as heavy armor become more sophisticated (and better padded\!), simple maces are once again becoming ineffective.
Maces are also commonly used by those opposed to cutting or cleaving an opponent.

Damage: 1d10+3+DB

AP: 1

### Clan Sword

*A Clan Sword is an example variant weapon.  While regarded as a sword by the cultures that produce it, it functions more like a mace mechanically.*

Clan Swords are wooden weapons used by some Wood Elf tribal cultures.
They are carefully hewn from sturdy hardwood, and finished with designs unique to the tribe that produced them.
Clan Swords arc like inverted sabres; have a narrow, diamond-like cross-section; and are weighted towards the very tip.
They almost always feature leather or linen lanyards to secure the weapon to the wielder's hand.

Tags: One-handed, Easy, Blunt, Secure, Well Suited: Maim, Well Suited: Mighty Blow

Damage: 1d10+3+DB

AP: 1

### Flanged Mace

*The flanged mace is an example of a customized weapon. The flanged mace is a variant of the mace developed in response to the effectiveness of modern armor; it trades off the mace’s ability to maim for greater AP.*

Flanged maces are a development of the mace designed to better defeat
armor; the heads are surrounded by raised ridges or flanges, which
concentrate the force of the blow on a smaller area, while being less
likely to deflect the way that blades do. Much like maces and clubs,
they are relatively easy to produce and use.

Tags: One-Handed, Easy, Blunt

Damage: 1d10+3+DB

### Warhammer

A weapon that has recently begun to see wider use, warhammers are
designed to defeat even sturdy, well-padded modern armors. They are
unlikely to deflect the way that blades often do, and they concentrate
all the force of a blow onto a very small area, allowing them to
punch-in and deform even heavy armor.

### Short Spear

A spear is essentially a metal point affixed to a shaft anywhere from
one to two-and-a-half meters long, designed for thrusting, pushing and
piercing attacks. Spears are perhaps the simplest, oldest and yet
most-common weapons in existence. Nearly every culture on the Emerald
Plane has deployed some variant of the spear, from the forked spears of
the bone-spiders to the two-meter-long steel-pointed spears commonly
used by the troops of the Goblin Empire when they fight in formation, to
the simple iron or stone-tipped spears used by countless tribal
cultures.

Short spears can be used one or two-handed, and are particularly
effective when paired with shields and used in formation. Short spears
can also be thrown.

Similar to a short-spear, but improvised — made quickly, possibly without being treated, probably without a metal tip.

Special: An improvised spear is Cost: Low.

## Two-Handed Weapons

Two-handed weapons forgo any kind of subtlety or flexibility, instead
opting for maximum weight and reach; they are large, imposing and heavy
devices for inflicting injury to an opponent. However, the lack of a
free hand can be limiting, as wielders cannot carry a (large) shield or
ranged weapon; this may leave a two-handed weapon user relying on
natural agility or heavy armor to carry them through a fight.

### Greatsword

A greatsword is a mighty, double-edged blade of up to 150cm of length.
The long handle and blade allow for a huge amount of leverage on a swing.
Many greatswords also feature a leather wrap around the base of the sword for half-handing, in order to use the sword in tight quarters where the length of the blade would otherwise be a problem.

Damage: 2d10+2+DB

### Reaping Sword

*The reaping sword is an example variant weapon. It is somewhat similar to a greatsword, but it is designed to be used by cavalry, primarily with the described “reaping attack”. It trades the flexibility of the sword — represented by the Close and Defensive tags — for usability on horseback or with mighty overhead slashes.*

This Shade-Elven weapon pairs a very long handle designed for a two
handed grip with a thin, single-edged blade with a slight curve. The
weapon is designed primarily for use by their mounted raiders; it is
well-suited to ride-by attacks, where the weapon is held out to the side
and used to “reap” any targets on foot. On foot, the weapon is heavy and
awkward; it lacks a sharpened point and cannot be used for thrusting, so
it is mainly used with vicious slashing attacks.

### Battle Axe

With a meter of handle and a weighty, massive head, battle-axes offer
massive weight and leverage that allows a wielder to deal massive damage
even to an armored opponent.

Tags: Two-handed, Heavy, Bladed, Blunt, Heavy

Damage; 2d10+1+DB

AP: 5

### Lumberjack Axe

A lumberjack’s axe is a two-handed utility axe used to fell trees
(rather than people). As with any heavy, bladed object that can easily
be swung, though, they make serviceable weapons in a pinch. Since they
are common tools, they are more readily available than martial
weapons — although they are also less-suited to combat, and less
effective at dealing with armor in particular.

### Long Club

Anything from sturdy walking stick to a broken chunk of furniture to a
heat-treated club, a “long club” is any blunt instrument of 150
centimeters of length or more. Able to be wielded in a variety of ways,
the Long Club is capable of poking, reaching attacks, and rapid-fire
close-range strikes.

Tags: Two-handed, Blunt, Easy, Utility, Reach

Damage: 2d10+3+DB

AP: 1

### Quarterstaff

*The quarterstaff is an example variant weapon. It is similar to a Long Club, except it trades slightly lower damage and AP for a variety of tags — including the One-Handed tag, with associated one-handed damage.*

A quarterstaff is a long staff made of sturdy wood. Though they are not
as deadly as metal weapons — and are ineffective at defeating armor in
particular — they are nevertheless versatile and effective weapons. They
can be wielded in a variety of different ways; notably, several of their
basic strikes are the same as those used with swords.

### Great Mace

A long, metal head atop an equally long handle, the Great Mace is a
brutal source of blunt trauma. Though a number of styles of heads exist,
from rounded metal shafts covered in spheroid studs to roughly cubical
heads with metal flanges at the corners, they tell a story of blunt,
forceful violence.

### Dragonshire Wyrmblade

*The Dragonshire Wyrmblade is an example variant weapon.  It is similar to a greatsword, but larger – to the extent that those without the stature of Drakes will struggle to use it.*

A type of massive sword unique to the Dragonshire, Wyrmblades are designed to take advantage of the natural strength and reach of Drakes, and to be effective when used in combination with the pole-arms of smaller races.
The name refers to a snake-like undulation incorporated into the blade.

Damage: 2d10+3+DB

AP: 4

Special: *Oversized*.  Users without the *Great Stature* tag take -10 to their attack checks and deal -2 DB.

### Orcish Sword

When Orcs fight as a unit, they use an unusual pole-arm.
It consists of double-sided, sword-like blade, perhaps 45cm long, at the end of a pole 200cm long or more.
The sword-end sometimes also sports guard-like blades at its base.

Tags: Two-handed, Reach, Bladed, Fend, Formation, Brace, Heavy

Damage: 2d10+2+DB, AP 2

## Pole Arms

Weapons consisting of heads mounted on long wooden hafts, pole-arms are
relatively simple to manufacture and are highly effective when used by
infantry formations. They are among the most common weapons used by
militaries throughout the Emerald Plane. Formations of infantry with
pole-arms can be an incredibly deadly force when wisely
deployed — although they can also be vulnerable if they are flanked or
forced into close combat.

### Long Spear

Longer and longer spears are being used as armor improves and mounted,
armored opponents become more common. Long spears are those that are
more than two meters long; they are primarily wielded two-handed, by
armored infantry, and cannot easily be thrown.

Formations of long-spearmen can be extremely effective, but they can
also be vulnerable if they are flanked and enveloped, or if the enemy
can effectively close with them and engage them in melee.

Tags: Two-handed, Easy, Reach, Vulnerable, Fend, Formation, Brace

Damage: 1d10+5+DB

[[designnote]]
|
|The combination of Vulnerable and Fend may seem a little odd.
|Vulnerable means that the weapon is not very useful when defending
|against an attack, while fend means that the weapon is good at keeping
|an opponent at range. This makes some sense, as long spears can be used
|to threaten an opponent into keeping their distance, but are not very
|good at parrying or defending should an opponent manage to get close.
|


### Halberd

A pike with a large, flat axe blade on one side, a halberd is capable of
both thrusting and slashing attacks. Often built slightly shorter than
spears, they still benefit from the range and reach of their design.

Though halberds are used to some extent by all the peoples of the
eastern Emerald Planes, they are particularly common in the
Commonwealth’s military — so much so that they are often used as a
symbol for the Commonwealth’s military.

### Lance

The traditional weapon of charging knights and heavy Cavalry. The lance
is a conical shaft of wood with a metallic, ceramic, or stone tip. War
Lances are designed to be disposable, breaking off in the target on a
successful hit. They are ill-suited to be used on foot, as they benefit
heavily from the added inertia and speed of a mounted charge, but can be
pressed into service as an awkward, heavy spear.

The knights of the Kingdoms of Men are the most common users of lances,
as humans are large and strong enough to wield the lance effectively,
but also small and nimble enough to ride a horse.

Damage: 1d10+2+DB (stationary, on foot) 2d10+3+DB (mounted charge)

AP: 1 (stationary, on foot), 6 (mounted charge)

### Lochaber Axe

Somewhat like a halberd, but shorter (at only 150 to 180cm) and with a
heavier head. Though the weapon still has significant reach, the extra
weight and shorter shaft mean that it is more difficult to thrust the
weapon at an opponent, and so it is more difficult to keep an opponent
at a distance. Of course, the additional weight makes it a more damaging
weapon better able to penetrate armor.

### Raven’s Beak

Similar to a warhammer, but with a much longer shaft, larger head and, customarily, a hook opposite the hammer-head.
The Raven’s Beak is a devastating weapon when used against a heavily-armored opponent.

### Throatcatcher

A polearm used extensively by slaveholding cultures to capture new "stock".
The weapon consists of a horseshoe-shaped hoop at the end of a long shaft, and is designed to nonlethally restrain the target.
In the Commonwealth, they are commonly used to move prisoners, and are designed to be non-lethal, and have blunted parrying surfaces.
The Goblin Empire and Shaded Sea use more dangerous variants of the weapon, equipped with blunted spikes inside the hoop, and angular blades for parrying.
They also use versions with different sized "heads" for use with different races.

The weapon is viewed as something of a symbol for *Gremlins*.
Because of their small size, they are swift riders; because of this, they are often dispatched mounted to run down the Goblin's retreating enemies, cutting them down or capturing them as slaves.
Throatcatchers are commonly used during these pursuits.

## Ranged Weapons

Ever since the first fight, the peoples of the Emerald Plane have been coming up with better ways to end fights from further and further away.
From primitive slings and throwing spears to modern crossbows and gunpowder weapons, ranged weapons are useful for killing opponents before they can kill you.
Though many older ranged weapons require quite a lot of strength to use, some newer ranged weapons don't rely as much on the wielder's strength, instead using mechanical or chemical energy to drive a projectile.

### Light Bow

Light bows are small bows suitable for a wide variety of uses; the class includes modern composite bows, recurve bows, traditional short cavalry bows, and many others.
The tactical flexibility of light bows is only amplified by the use of specialized arrows.

Both Wood and Shade elves commonly use light bows — wood elves for their lightness and flexibility while hunting, and shade elves as mounted weapons for their infamous cavalry.
Shade Elf mounted archers remain terrifying soldiers in service of the Shaded Sea Peoples.

### Composite Bow Rev

Composite bows are made of several materials in layers — often bone on the back and sinew on the front — which allows the bow to store more energy in a smaller package with a shorter draw.
This makes these bows particularly small, and thus well-suited for use by cavalry (and others who value the small size of the weapon).

Both Wood and Shade elves commonly use light bows — wood elves for their lightness and flexibility while hunting, and shade elves as mounted weapons for their infamous and devastating cavalry.

### Longbow

A longbow is a bow that is 180cm in length or more. Longbows require
incredible strength to draw, and so their wielders are often some of the
largest and strongest soldiers on the battlefield. Longbows are also
very difficult to use; proficiency with the longbow almost requires the
wielder to be raised to it, and so only cultures that have a “culture of
the bow” can boast many longbowmen.

The Herders have such a “culture of the bow,” and Herder longbowmen have
long provided the Commonwealth with a powerful advantage in their
conflict with the Shaded Sea Peoples — despite the Herder’s relative lack
of brute strength. This era may be coming to a close, however, as
crossbows replace longbows even in Herders’ hands.

Some Goblin Warlords have also cultivated a mastery of the longbow; the
Goblin longbowmen so produced are coveted assets, whom Goblin kings
competed over and who the Goblin Empire now pays handsomely for.

Humans have both the strength and dexterity to make excellent
longbowmen; some kingdoms within the Kingdoms of Men practice the
longbow, and have produced some of the most proficient longbowmen that
the Emerald Plane has seen. However, these longbowmen are often drawn
from the peasant classes, and are often deployed without proper training
or equipment; this hinders their effectiveness.

### Light Crossbow

A more recent innovation, the crossbows first appeared some 500 years
ago and have been improving steadily since. Light crossbows have been
replacing bows because they are much easier to use (which greatly
reduces training time), because they can be stored with a bolt readied,
and because they can hurl a bolt with incredible force (without
requiring great strength form the user).

Light crossbows are particularly common in both the Commonwealth and the
Kingdoms of Men. Notably, the Commonwealth has recently begun deploying
Kobold archers armed with light crossbows; these small creatures often
make excellent archers, and their crossbows allow them to launch a bolt
with great force despite their tiny stature. Though originally greeted
with scorn by the Kingdoms of Men and the Goblin Empire, they have since
learned to fear these quick, stealthy, and deadly archers.

### Heavy Crossbow

These recent designs combine an all-steel prod with a windlass (a crank
that draws the bow). These weapons require much more time to fully draw
with the windlass, but also allow a draw-strength that no humanoid
creature could accomplish with muscle alone. Heavy Crossbows are the
modern battlefield’s premiere weapon for defeating heavy armor at range.

Owing to their much larger economy and much greater ability to produce
high-quality steel, these weapons are currently being deployed heavily
by the Commonwealth. In particular, since the Herders became
Commonwealth members proper, Herder archers equipped with
human-manufactured heavy crossbows have become a terrifying force on the
battlefield.

Special: an additional Standard Action can be taken to fully draw the
bow. When fully drawn, the weapon uses the damage and AP listed for
Overcharge.

### Repeating Crossbow

Deep-Explorer Dwarves use a type of repeating crossbow designed to exploit their access to exotic venoms, and to perform well in the tight, narrow, curling tunnels of their homes.
It fires rapidly by levering the firing mechanism back-and-forth under the stock; it stores bolts in a "hopper" on top of the weapon, and uses their own weight to feed them; and it re-stringing the bow on the backstroke.
While this mechanism cannot draw the bow to any great weight, it can be used to rapidly fire a hail of bolts.

These weapons are short-barreled and low-powered; instead of the high-damage and effective armor-penetration of other crossbows, they rely on volume of fire and poisoned bolts for effectiveness.

Tags: Two-Handed, Ranged, Prone, Rapid Fire, Reload, Soak

Damage 1D10+1

AP: 2

Reload: Quick Action per bolt

Special: Magazine.  Repeating Crossbows have a fixed *hopper* or *magazine* on top of the weapon.
Bolts are placed into the top of the box to load the weapon, and their own weight causes them to fall through the bottom into the weapon.  In effect, the crossbow reloads itself from the *hopper* as it fires, and the user need only reload the *hopper* after it is empty.  The magazines typically have a capacity of 10 bolts.

Special: The weapon continues to fire as long as the catch is depressed.
The bolt can be "tapped" to fire a single bolt, given a *short* squeeze to fire several bolts, or held down to fire all the bolts in the magazine.

When firing the crossbow, choose whether to *tap* the trigger, give it a *short squeeze*, or *empty the magazine*, and use the following modifiers:

- a *tap* first a single bolt and functions normally.
- a *short* squeeze uses up to 3 bolts; if all three are fired, deals \+1d10 DV, and gains +10 to the attack check.
- a *long* squeeze uses up to 10 bolts; if at least five are fired, deals \+3d10 DV, and gains +20 to the attack check.

### Sling

A leather strap with a small pouch at the middle, slings use centrifugal
force and wrist strength to propel small projectiles (often rocks or
large nuts) up to blistering speeds. Though often considered a child's
toy or a tool for hunting vermin, they can still be lethal in the right
hands.

Caravan-going Halflings make frequent use of these weapons, owing to
their small size, cheap and easy construction, ease of provision (as
they don’t require specialized ammunition), and easy concealment.

Range: 10/20/40/80

Reload: no action (you can select a projectile, pouch it, and start

### Special Arrows

The following *special arrows* can be used with composite bows and longbows:

- **Diamond**: *Diamond* arrows are named for the cross-section of the arrowhead, not the material they're made of (they're just wood, with a steel arrowhead).  Diamond arrows are particularly good at penetrating armor.  Diamond arrows have +2 AP and gain the *Piercing* tag.  Diamond arrows are Cost: Minor for 6 arrows.
- **Improvised**: *improvised* arrows are hastily constructed; they might not be properly fletched, and they might not even have a metal tip.  They do -1 DV and have -1 AP; if they aren't even properly fletched, they impose a -10 penalty to the attack check.  Improvised Arrows are Cost: Minor for 12 arrows.
- **Broadhead**: *broadhead* arrows have large heads that trail *edges* that can be sharpened.  Broadheads are particularly good at wounding flesh, and often cause bleeding.  Broadhead arrows do +1 DV, and cause *Bleeding 1* on an exceptional or critical success.  On the down-side, their large heads are somewhat more expensive.  Broadhead arrows are Cost: Minor for 4 arrows.
- **Needle**: *needle* arrows have an extremely narrow circular cross-section, like a needle.  They are cheap to make, they are good at penetrating armor, and they fly further (owing to the lower drag).  On the down-side, though, they are easy to deflect if they do not strike head-on.  Needle arrows are AP 3, have the *Piercing* tag, and gain +25m to each range increment.  If the attacker only scores a normal success, their DV is halved.  Needle arrows are Cost: Minor for 8.
- **Blunts**: *blunt* arrows are designed to *stun* a target, rather than kill it.  Rather than being sharpened to a point, blunt arrows are… blunted.  Some are even covered with hide, wadding, or another soft material.  (Of course, users should be aware that any time you're causing trauma to a target, serious injury and death are always possibilities.)  Blunt arrows halve the DV they do and are AP 0.  Blunt arrows are Cost: Minor for 6.
- **Rush**: the heads of *rush* arrows are magical; they induce air to flow quickly over their thin blades or wings.  If an arrow where to be activated and held, this would produce a steady, strong breeze; when activated in flight, this propels the arrow powerfully forward.  (This effect only lasts for a few seconds — long enough to be useful when fired at a target)  This allows these arrows to travel great distances and strike with extreme force; the fragility of the magical arrowhead somewhat limits their damage and armor-penetration, but the great speed at impact largely makes up for this.  Rush arrows add +10m/+25m/+40m/+50m to each range bracket, +2 DV, but -1 AP (that is, they are worse at penetrating armor).  One Rush arrow is Cost: Minor.

As always, this list is not exhaustive; players and GMs should feel free to add more as desired.

[[playerguidance]]
|
|*Improvised arrows* are listed even though we don't track "normal" ammo consumption, because you never know when you'll have your arrows stolen, or when the GM will declare that, over the course of the last month of travel, you've definitely run out of arrows.
|


[[designnote]]
|
|As-written, these arrows can't be used with crossbows, because we assume that that crossbow bolts have very different *terminal ballistics* that impose tighter constraints on how their bolt-heads can be designed and how differently they can perform.
|Basically, they travel faster and strike harder, so the heads probably have to be designed more similarly to punch through armor.
|
|Of course, "we" (meaning the lead author) could *very easily* be wrong about this — or this might just be boring — so GMs and players should feel free to disregard this restriction.

## Exotic Weapon

### Shade-Elf Punch Dagger

*This weapon is an example variant weapon; it is based on the dagger. These weapons are difficult to use, but they are larger than normal daggers and more difficult to disarm.*

Shade elves use these unusual weapons with an energetic and mobile
fighting style; practitioners dart forward and back quickly, making
vicious thrusts on forward lunges and parrying and guarding when they
dart back.

### Flail

Military flails are one of several martial weapons derived from
agricultural tools; agricultural flails are used in threshing. Military
flails are two-handed weapons consisting of a long wooden shaft, to
which a heavy wooden or metal striking head is attached by a hinge
(which is normally little more than two interlocked metal loops); some
also feature short lengths of metal change to attach the head. Because
they are heavy and are not rigid, military flails can be awkward to
handle and swing, and some of the force of a blow is wasted; however,
they can be useful because the hinged head allows them to potentially
strike around a guard or shield.

### War-Fork

The war-fork is an example variant weapon. “Knives” are a very diverse
class of weapons, of which the war-fork is a member. War-forks loose the
utility and soak tags, and gain the Difficult tag; in exchange, though,
they gain the Catch and Well Suited: Catch and Disarm tags. Because they
have both the Catch and Well Suited: Catch tags, they are incredibly
good at trapping enemy weapons\!

Developed from an agricultural tool used in handling bails of grain,
war-forks are small, one-handed weapons consisting of a central
long-and-narrow blade, coupled with two smaller blades or tines mounted
on either side. The the central blade is usually sharpened along its
length, it is primarily useful for thrusting attacks. The unusual weapon
is somewhat difficult to use, but it is very versatile, and in
particular allows for a number of defensive techniques, including
parrying and blade-catching. These weapons are also very light, and are
often used in pairs.

### Hand Cannon

There have been sporadic attempts to miniaturize cannons for use by
single infantry for more than 100 years, but only within the last 65
have workable hand-cannons begun to appear. Hand-cannons, as the name
implies, are much like miniature cannons; they consist of a barrel, a
chamber with a hole tapped into it, and a socket to which a longer
wooden grip is attached. The cannon is loaded by packing powder and a
projectile down the barrel, and fired by holding a lit object up to the
touch hole. Though a wide variety of projectiles can be used with
hand-cannons — among them arrows and rocks — metal balls manufactured
specifically for the purpose have become common.

Hand-cannons are heavy and awkward; while it is possible to hold it with
one hand and touch off the weapon with the other, it is difficult to do.
In practice, the weapons are often used by a pair of soldiers: one who
holds and aims the weapon while the other touches it off.

The Commonwealth are the heaviest users of these weapons, with the Goblin Empire being a close second.

Much like crossbows, it takes time to reload a hand-cannon; for this reason, it is not uncommon to discard the hand-cannon after it has been fired, and the weapon is only retrieved and reloaded after combat.
This is especially likely to be the case if the weapon is not being carried by a team.

The projectiles fired by hand-cannons fly extremely rapidly, and are incredibly *hard to dodge* (this means that fray checks are divided by 2; see the *Guns* alternate rule).

**Damage:** 3d10+2

**Range:** 25m/50m/125m/200m

**Reload:** 4 Standard Actions

**Special:** If you have a partner helping you operate the weapon, then it looses the Difficult tag (as it is easy for you to aim, and easy for them to fire).  Working with a partner, you can also reload a hand-cannon with only two Standard Actions.

### Whip

Whips are common tools for managing livestock and work-animals;
they consist of long, slender pieces of tanned leather.
Though they are very painful, they are not nearly as dangerous as purpose-built weapons, they are all but useless against even the slightest armor, and cannot be used to parry or defend against a close attacker.
Nevertheless, some do use them for self-defense, as a less-lethal weapon, to disarm opponents or to move small objects at range.

### Dragon’s Axe

*The Dragon’s Axe is an example unique weapon. As the description says, the Dragon’s Axe allows the wielder access to at least one powerful, armor-defeating shot, without leaving them defenseless in melee combat. Such a weapon might have an unreliable firing mechanism, or it might have a weaker shaft (owing to it being hollow to double as a barrel)—or it also might not\! The weapon might be perfectly servicable as both an axe and matchlock. The choice is up to the player and the GM, and depends on what the CP cost of the weapon is, and what kind of “feel” the GM wants for the setting, and the player wants for their character.*

A unique weapon built to order at great expense to the Dragonshire noble
that commissioned it, it was designed to make the might of gunpowder
available to its wielder without leaving them vulnerable in
close-combat. The axe’s shaft is reinforced, and also serves as the
barrel of a projectile weapon; the handle has a sophisticated,
matchlock-like mechanism to trigger the weapon.
