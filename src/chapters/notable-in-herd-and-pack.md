# Notable in Herd-and-Pack

## Major City: Five Rivers (Kauhnahei)

[[abstract]]
|
|Five Rivers is situated on the top of a prominent hill 6 *demarc* west of the rough center of Herd-and-Pack province, in the rolling hills and small rivers of the center-west of the Emerald Plane.
|It was the Herder's oldest and greatest city, its construction predating the founding of Herd-and-Pack by almost two hundred years.
|Historically, it served as the de-facto capital of the Herd-and-Pack Alliance; today, it is the seat-of-administration for Herd-and-Pack Province.
|It's Commonwealth name is derived from the surrounding network of rivers that it commands; a rough transliteration of the Herder name is "*Kauhnahei*," which is believed to derive from the (fairly literal) phrase "Great Hill City."
