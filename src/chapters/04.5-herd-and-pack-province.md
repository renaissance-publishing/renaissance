# Herd-and-Pack Province

Herd-and-Pack Province sits in a stretch of patchy forests and rising hills north of Westward Province; it consists of the territory of the former Herd-and-Pack Alliance, an alliance principally between several Herder and Gnoll tribes to resist the Shade Elves.
Owing to a common enemy, the Herd-and-Pack Alliance had been allies of the Commonwealth since the latter first built settlements near the rolling steppe and praire of the west; with the Compact, the Alliance joined the Commonwealth as a province.
Though they meet all their obligations under the Compact, Herd-and-Pack remains somewhat insular; they largely practice their own traditional ways of life, and have showe less interest in trade and exchange with the larger Commonwealth.

[[abstract]]
|
|Five Rivers is situated on the top of a prominent hill 6 *demarc* west of the rough center of Herd-and-Pack province, in the rolling hills and small rivers of the center-west of the Emerald Plane.
|It was the Herder's oldest and greatest city, its construction predating the founding of Herd-and-Pack by almost two hundred years.
|Historically, it served as the de-facto capital of the Herd-and-Pack Alliance; today, it is the seat-of-administration for Herd-and-Pack Province.
|It's Commonwealth name is derived from the surrounding network of rivers that it commands; a rough transliteration of the Herder name is "*Kauhnahei*," which is believed to derive from the (fairly literal) phrase "Great Hill City."
