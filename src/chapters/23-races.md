# Races

Here we will provide the information that players will need to build a character of a particular race.
This includes a short description of their history, cultures, and ethnic groups; physical descriptions; vitals; and, importantly, their mechanical features.

We've divided this into several sections:

- the common races of the Commonwealth;
- some of the more unusual races of the Commonwealth;
- some of the races of the neighboring nations; and,
- a few of the more exotic and unusual races of the world.

Note that every race will have on of three special tags: Natural, Supernatural or Spirit.
This tells you whether the race is flesh-and-blood (Natural), has some inborn supernatural quality (Supernatural), or is composed (primarily or entirely) of magical energy (Spirit).

Some races have optional Traits, Classes, Powers or Backgrounds.
You donâ€™t acquire them for free; rather, they are added to your list of options at character creation, and you may *optionally* select them using all the normal rules for taking Traits, Classes, Powers or Backgrounds during character creation.
(So, for example, Shifters don't *just have* the Animal Form trait, but they can purchase it during character creation for CP, just like any other trait they are eligible for.)

[[designnote]]
| Because we'd like to emphasize that a member of any race can grow up in any culture, we've tried to limit the fixed features in each *races* block to only those biological characteristics that every member of a given race would have, regardless of background.

| We'd like race selection to be interesting and impactful, but we also want to avoid locking any race into (or out of) any particular role, or giving any race an edge in a role that a character from no other race could catch up to.
