# Westward Province

Westward Province is a narrow strip of heavily-fortified land running from the Worldspine to the east to the western coast.
It was the Commonwealth's original path to the coast, and to the Haven Isles.
It has seen constant raiding and incursion from the Shade Elves to the south, and has thus been heavily fortified â€” it is the most militarized and heavily-defended province of the Commonwealth, and includes some of its largest and most modern star-forts.
