## Traits, Powers, and Classes

What's a fantasy game without magical powers and fantastic swordplay?

We use *traits*, *powers*, and *classes* to represent the various unique quirks, powerful abilities, unique connections, and practiced tricks that characters can have; collectively, we call these *features*.

- A **trait** represents an innate property that a character has,
- a **power** represents an action that a character can perform, and
- **Classes** are a little more variable, but they often represent an *experience* that a character has had.

A **trait** represents an *innate* property that a character has, like being particularly brave or having unusually fast reflexes.
Most traits are "always-on"; if someone is *ambidextrous*, they're ambidextrous *all* the time, not just *some* of the time, after all.
Importantly, traits aren't actions (like powers), and traits usually aren't acquired through experience (like classes).

A **power** represents a unique ability that a character has.
Powers are usually discrete actions (even a sustained action is still an action that you're consciously performing at some times and not others).
Also, powers are often learned: they often represent a "trick" that a character has drilled to perfection, possibly with the aid of magical preparation or mundane set-up.
(Although some powers may represent a unique ability that members of some races possess.)

**Classes** are a little more variable.
They often represent an *experience* that a character has had.
Very often, they represent a membership a character has (or had) in some organization — which might have given them some special training, or access to their resources, or reciprocal obligations.
These Classes commonly take two forms: they either let you "break the rules" in some interesting way (like the *Channeler*) or they give you access to an organization's resources (like *Guild Member*).

More rarely, Classes can give a character a special feature, like *Corpse-Herder* and *Familiar-Bound Mage*.
Both conceptually and mechanically, these are a little awkward: they're classes essentially because they're not *traits* (since they're not innate), and they're not *powers* (because they aren't discrete actions—"having a magical pet" isn't really an action that you perform).
They're closest to an experience that you've had — the experience of "having made a magical companion."
