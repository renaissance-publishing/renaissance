# Haven Province

Haven Province consists of the Haven Isles, a large island chain off the western coast of the Emerald Plane.
Besides the original Human and Gnollish settlers from the Commonwealth, the Haven Isles have absorbed a large number of other populations: ratfolk refugees from the Warren Isles, Shade Elves from the inland praire, Dwarves from Northland, and Kobolds from the Eastern Kingdoms.
It is also the birthplace of the Ash Elves.
The Haven Isles are generally urban and cosmopolitan, and are something of a hot-bed of cultural exchange and political thought; in particular, they are known for the sophisticated administration and complex, federalized system of government.

## Common Language: Ashen

[[abstract]]
|
|Ashen is a (highly complex) language spoken primarily by Ash Elves.

|Group: HHED

|Partially Intelligeble: Keillou (-10), Merchant Voyager (-10), Weal (-20), Shipwright Hud (-20)

|Special: Ashen is a difficult language to learn, imposing a -10 penalty on related checks.

Ashen is the highly complex language spoken by the Ash Elves of the Haven Isles.
It is a complex synthesis of several languages: while its earliest roots lie in Keillou (the language of the Shade Elves), it has since been influenced heavily by the (unrelated) languages of various Wood Elf and Shifter tribes, by Haven Weal, by Shipwright Hud, and even by Autumn Caravaneer.

On the one hand, Ashen is a very expressive language; it has access to a rich pallet of widely-varied elements.
On the other hand, it is *very* difficult to learn, being composed as it is of a half-dozen different languages.

## Common Language: Islander Skinned

[[abstract]]
|
|Islander Skinned is a derivative of several languages, principally based on Weal; it is slowly replacing regional variants of other languages as the first language for the Skinned — that is, furless — Folk of the Haven Isles.

|Group: HHED
|
|Partially Intelligeble: Haven Weal (-10), other Weal derivatives (-20), Keillou (-20), Hel (-20), Shipwright Hud (-30)

Islander Skinned is a language commonly spoken throughout the Haven Isles; it is distantly based on Haven Weal, but includes elements of many other languages.
The language is artificial; it is a formalized variant of Haven Weal, but also draws on many of the other languages of the Haven Isles, with the deliberate intent of creating a language that can be shared by the many "skinned" — that is, furless — folk of the Haven Isles.

As such, it is slowly displacing Shipwright Hud, Hel, Haven Weal, and several other languages as a frist language in the islands — although many of those peoples and cultures have hold-outs attempting to preserve their original languages.

While the language is a complex blend of many unrelated languages like Ashen, it is much easier to learn; it was very deliberately designed to be "regular" in its forms and easy to master.

## Common Language: Islander Furred

[[abstract]]
|
|Islander Furred is principally derived from Haven Gnollish, though it has been influenced by Cqik.
|Like Islander Skinned, it is designed to be shared by the "furred" racees of the Haven Isles, and is slowly replacing their other languages as the primary language of the "furred folk" of the Haven Isles.
|
|Group: GR
|
|Partially Intelligeble: Haven Gnollish, Cqik (-10), other derivatives of Gnollish and Cqik (-20)

Much as Islander Skinned, Islander Furred is a formalized, artificial language designed to unite several distinct communities in the Haven Isles, each with their own language.
Islander Furred is primarily based on Haven Gnollish, though it also borrows from Cqik; like Islander Skinned, it has also been simplified and made more regular, to make it easier to learn and master.

It is slowly displacing Haven Gnollish and Cqik a sa first language among the Gnolls and Ratfolk (respectively) of the HAven Isles — although, again like Islander Skinned, each community has its traditionalists and hold-outs.

## Major City: Union

[[abstract]]
|
|In Haven Isles style, Union is technically an "administrative region" consisting of three conjoined subterranean cities sharing a common central cavern, built under the peaks of Islandhome (the largest of the Haven Isles).
|One city is Ash-Elven, one is Shipwright Dwarven, and one — the newest — is Kobold; in the center, connecting the three, sits a bustling "public square" cavern that is istelf larger than some small cities.
|Union is, in many ways, the cultural center of the Haven Isles, and the three cultures at its heart; it is, unsurprisingly, also the capital of Haven Isles.
