# Backgrounds

## Backgrounds

Your *Background* represents what you have gained from your early life experiences — the influences your culture had on you, from growing up wherever you grew up.

The list presented here is far from exhaustive; there are countless cultures great and small throughout the Emerald and Ruby Planes (and beyond!), and we have presented only a handful.
Players and GMs should feel free to modify these backgrounds to represent a specific character's unique origins (players require their GM's approval, of course).

None of these backgrounds should be taken to be exclusive to a given race; in general, a member of any race can grow up in any given culture, and thus have the appropriate background.
It's entirely possible for an Ash Elf to grow up in the Dragonshire, or a Shifter to grow up in one of the Commonwealth's large cities.
This is true not only of the common backgrounds, but also of the rarer, (seemingly) race-specific ones; it's entirely possible for a Human to grow up among Gnolls and Halflings in a trade-caravan, for example, or for a Gnoll to grow up in an Ash-Elven undercity.

[[gmguidance | What should be in a background]]
|
|Most of the backgrounds give you 40CP of benefits, which represent the skills and resources that most members of your culture acquire.
|
|Ranks in skills, traits, and items are common choices; these repesent the skills that every member of a culture would acquire, the abilities that people commonly learn, and the kinds of possessions that are common among them.
|Ranks in skills are usually a good place to start; you can branch out into traits and items if you can't come up with 40 CP of particularly unique or exciting ranks in skills.
|(There's no reason a background can't award a class or power, but in our opinion this makes a little less sense and is a little harder to balance, and so is often best avoided.)
|
|Backgrounds *usually* shouldn't include things that it's impossible to acquire somewhere else, although this is mostly for game design and balance reasons; we find it very frustrating to force people into taking a particular background in order to have access to some trait or skill.
