title: "The Unplacable Text Describing What Adventures Look Like"

I need to work on this some. I’m not sure I want the setting to have a
final fate that’s this bleak, but there are elements of it that I like
and that I want to keep.

## What you do

This needs to go somewhere else.

  - You won't:
    
      - raid ancient temples for artifacts: modern knowledge eclipses
        anything of past ages
      - slay bands of robbers: large and well-funded Commonwealth
        military keeps large bandit problems from cropping up – most of
        the time, at least
      - slay monsters: most “monsters” are your neighbors, and the ones
        that aren't, the military deals with

  - You might:
    
      - venture into neighboring kingdoms under cover to keep them from
        threatening you
      - deal with local city-crime problems (gangs, the mob, or
        government corruption)
      - deal with local tragedies in the Heartland (manors are allowed
        to collapse if they fuck up: Heartland is a little like Fantasy
        Extropia)
      - Deal with problems caused by troublesome (or mysterious, or
        brutal) spirits
