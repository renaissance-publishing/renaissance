# Notable in Haven Province

## Major City: Union

[[abstract]]
|
|In Haven Isles style, Union is technically an "administrative region" consisting of three conjoined subterranean cities sharing a common central cavern, built under the peaks of Islandhome (the largest of the Haven Isles).
|One city is Ash-Elven, one is Shipwright Dwarven, and one — the newest — is Kobold; in the center, connecting the three, sits a bustling "public square" cavern that is istelf larger than some small cities.
|Union is, in many ways, the cultural center of the Haven Isles, and the three cultures at its heart; it is, unsurprisingly, also the capital of Haven Isles.
