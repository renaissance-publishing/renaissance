# Haven Province

Haven Province consists of the Haven Isles, a large island chain off the western coast of the Emerald Plane.
Besides the original Human and Gnollish settlers from the Commonwealth, the Haven Isles have absorbed a large number of other populations: ratfolk refugees from the Warren Isles, Shade Elves from the inland praire, Dwarves from Northland, and Kobolds from the Eastern Kingdoms.
It is also the birthplace of the Ash Elves.
The Haven Isles are generally urban and cosmopolitan, and are something of a hot-bed of cultural exchange and political thought; in particular, they are known for the sophisticated administration and complex, federalized system of government.

## Major City: Union

[[abstract]]
|
|In Haven Isles style, Union is technically an "administrative region" consisting of three conjoined subterranean cities sharing a common central cavern, built under the peaks of Islandhome (the largest of the Haven Isles).
|One city is Ash-Elven, one is Shipwright Dwarven, and one — the newest — is Kobold; in the center, connecting the three, sits a bustling "public square" cavern that is istelf larger than some small cities.
|Union is, in many ways, the cultural center of the Haven Isles, and the three cultures at its heart; it is, unsurprisingly, also the capital of Haven Isles.
