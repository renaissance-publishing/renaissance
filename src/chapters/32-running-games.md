## Designing Adventures

  - Remember that Renaissance is supposed to be balanced between several
    different areas — acquiring resources, fighting, sneaking, social
    scenes and analysis. Don’t let any one of these become too large.

  - Individual adventures are often short.

  - Long “arcs” can be broken into *chapters*, where a chapter
    represents a single, contained adventure.
    
      - Chapters can take anywhere between 4-12 sessions, and usually
        represent between 3 and 14 days in the game world.

  - Separate chapters with stretches of *down time*.
    
      - This is important: healing is hard, and psychological healing is
        *very* hard; your players will need plenty of time between
        chapters to rest and recuperate.
      - This is also when players will recharge their Trade Goods,
        crafters will make things, and players will pursue their
        projects (like building businesses, or crewing ships, or
        developing new powers).

  - An individual chapter — whether a self-contained adventure or a
    component of a longer arc — should include an even balance of
    elements.
    
      - A common pattern is to start by handing players a mission or a
        clue; then, the early part of the adventure is often
        investigating, find people of interest and figuring out what’s
        going on.

  - Remember that climactic events in Renaissance don’t need to be
    fights.
    
      - They *can* be, but they don’t *need* to be.
      - Nothing is wrong with having the ultimate enemy be a deeply evil
        noble who is useless in a fight.

  - Problems should have diverse solutions.
    
      - Make sure there are multiple ways to solve any given problem, so
        that different characters with different skillsets can all be
        active and useful.
    
      - Embrace solutions to problems that aren’t fighting.
    
      - If you have a Backer-type character, be sure to allow them to
        occasionally simply use their money or prestige to escape
        trouble and solve problems.
        
          - (This is worth being specific about because the kinds of
            solutions that Backer-type characters will come up with are
            likely to be the kinds of solutions that GMs would work
            really hard to disallow in a D\&D game.)

  - Renaissance chapters can lean on background and setting a lot more
    than D\&D games do.
    
      - This is partly because Renaissance has a lot more non-combat
        than D\&D, but
      - it’s also because Renaissance enemies tend to be Spirits, with
        cinematic (rather than mechanical) powers.
      - You’ll need to have a good enough idea of what the world that
        the players are in should be like, and what kind of resources
        should be available to them, that they can explore it,
        investigate, ask questions and talk to people.

  - Evil Spirits make good ultimate villains.
    
      - Remember, powerful Spirits should be handled “cinematically,” as
        opposed to mechanically. Don’t “stat-out the gods.”
    
      - Defeating Spirits might hinge on having specific magical
        implements, or knowledge of specific rituals — or the backing of
        *other* powerful spirits. The campaign might turn on acquiring
        these resources.
    
      - (When this is true, it’s good to hint to your players that they
        have no chance of defeating a given spirit in a fight, and need
        to look for other options.)
    
      - Spirits should also be *menacing* and *strange*:
        
          - menacing in the sense that they are vastly more powerful
            than the characters, and might be extremely dangerous — and
            the characters might be helpless if the spirit decides to
            turn on them, which it might do for no other reason than it
            wants to.
          - Strange in the sense that mortals may no nothing at all
            about the intent or nature of a given spirit, and its plans,
            objectives and behaviors might be completely obscured to
            lesser beings.

  - Rewards
    
      - Money, Trade Goods, valuables (like land) and favors the rich
        and powerful all make good rewards; these can be good fuel for
        roll-playing, and can be very useful to PCs during Down Time
        (and future adventures).
    
      - Specific magical items make very *poor* rewards. Remember that
        Renaissance is designed around having a small number of
        interesting features — that is, powers and items.
        
          - If you give a player an item that they didn’t ask for, they
            might not find it *interesting*; it might become the least
            of several options the player has available.
          - Remember that players should be the primary authors of their
            features; if they want a power or weapon, *they* should be
            the ones to come up with it.
          - Realize that players can just make their own features; a
            crafter can make any magical weapon or armor that they want
            during down-time, and a spellcaster (or psion or fighter or
            cleric) can make a new power. Why give them an item they may
            not be interested in, when they can just make their own
            during the next Down Time?
    
      - If you feel that you must give your PCs magical “power toys,”
        then *potions* make good rewards.
        
          - Potions can have a range of magical effects, which can be
            both powerful and interesting.
          - Because they are expensive and single-use, players might not
            invest resources in stock-piling them.
          - It might be tricky to come up with specific effects, that
            are interesting without being overpowered (or useless).
          - Again, tho, remember that you shouldn’t reward them with a
            potion that a character with 50 ranks in Craft: Alchemy
            couldn’t just make.

  - Enemies
    
      - One of the down-sides of being mostly defined by skills is that
        enemies can seem generic.
      - Interesting items and powers can go a long way towards making an
        enemy seem *unique*.
      - Sometimes just being an interesting race or employing an
        interesting tactic can help make an individual enemy stand out.
