# Northland Province

Northland Province consists of territories in the far north, on both the east and west of the Worldspine â€” the peaks of the Worldspine are lower in the extreme north of its range, so it poses less of a barrior.
It is the homeland of both the Orcs and Dwarves; notably, in both cases, some clans joined the Commonwealth, while others did not.
