I'll comment this out for now.  While this text is good, I think it's already present somewhere else.

While we like the flexibility that this gives the system, it does create a problem: some players greatly miss the kind of guidance that those "mechanics" and "systems" provide.
If you have that problem, then, when designing your character, you may want to start by trying to think about the kinds of things you want your character to be able to do--which might mean imagining them in specific scenarios and then thinking about how they sovle the problems they encounter--and then pick skills that represent those tactics and abilities.
When playing your character, you might want to first decide what you want your character to *d0*, and then allow the GM to decide which skill checks are required and what your modifiers are.
(And not that there is not necessarily one correct answer to that question!)

If you're the GM and you're having trouble picking skills, remember that the skill system is *intended* to be open-ended and flexible.
You do want to be consistant and you don't want to be too lax, but you *don't* need to worry too much about picking exactly which skill and exactly which modifier is required in every given situation.
And there's nothing wrong with asking a player which skill they think applies, or giving them a choice of skills--because its entirely possible that they might have more than one applicable skill!

### The Manors of Heartland

Social organization in the older provinces of the Commonwealth — at least, in Heartland and Westward provinces — is based around a decentralized form of manorialism.

Manors are, archetypically, small towns, with a number of homes and artisans clustered at the center, surrounded surrounded by fields and forests.
The form and organization of these manors — how the fields are divided up, how they are worked, what dues are due to whom — can vary widely.

Manors are, classically, overseen by a founding noble Lord or central organization, who holds their *charter*; though the Commonwealth has abolished serfdom, these charter-holders often remain powerful within their holdings.
(It is entirely possible for the residents of a manor to hold its charter directly; though somewhat rare in centuries past, this has become more and more common.)

Most manors — with the support of the surrounding hamlets — are self-sufficient, producing enough food to support their local populace, and often having a small number of local artisans to produce whatever else they may need.
(In fact, the Commonwealth has command of a large array of sophisticated farming techniques and technologies, making the fields around their manors highly productive; this allows them to support their relatively large urban populations, as well as their full-time military.)
Manors often specialize; some may have larger planted fields, allowing them to produce more food for export, possibly to support a nearby city; others may have a larger stock of artisans, producing worked goods for sale; still others may host some organization — a temple, a college, or a particular artisan's guild, for example.
(In fact, manors are often founded by such organizations — temples, colleges, guilds, and so on — for the express purpose of providing support.)

Heartland also hosts a large number of well-established cities — although "large" is a somewhat relative term.
Most cities have a population between five and ten thousand, well short of Crossroad's staggering two million.
Cities are almost never self-sufficient in terms of food, instead being dependent on the support of nearby manors; they do, however, host large communities of artisans and specialized workers, and are major producers of finished goods, from plows to magical mechanisms.
They also often host communities of traders and vibrant markets; it is often the market-squares of cities where residents of manors bring their crops to be sold, and where those same manor-folk purchase goods from finished steel to silk.
Cities also commonly host temples, to help ensure the good favor of the local spirits.

It is also typically cities that grant, recognize, and — where necessary — defend the charters of manors.
Perhaps confusingly, charter-granting cities are sometimes called "city-states" — not to be confused with city-*provinces*, a term reserved for the few truly massive cities that have top-level *provincial* status in the Commonwealth (Crossroads, for example).
These arrangements are often spelled out in charters; they may obligate a manor to provide a certain yield of food, raw materials, or labor, while in turn obligating the city to arrange for the defense of the manor.

#### Westward Province

The culture in Westward is similar, as it was carried West from Heartland.
It is, however, more militarized — and definitely more fortified.

### 

The Commonwealth contains a great many people, and its culture has changed drastically as the centuries have passed and the Commonwealth has spread.
This description of hamlets, manors and cities may be how most outsiders think of the Commonwealth, but it is most true of Heartland Province.
Other peoples in other places can vary significantly.
The Dragonshire, for example, has a nominal King, and a nobility; historically, it has been from their authority that charters have been derived.
Urban centers in the Dragonshire (and the lords who reside in them) have also done a better job at bringing far-flung manors and towns more directly under their control, building a more centralized administration and more directly integrating the culture of city and town.
In the Haven Isles,


      - Manors will be surrounded by fields, which are divided into
        plots; though each plot will usually be “owned” by a specific
        family, entire manors frequently cooperate to farm all of the
        plots, and the yield of all of the fields is often shared.
      - Manors often host local administrators and priests.
      - Manors also often host populations of artisans, often small.
      - Manors often host traders.
      - Manors can specialize in what they produce; while almost all
        manors are self-sufficient in terms of food production, some
        produce food for trade, while others have larger populations of
        artisans and produce goods for trade instead. Manors owned by
        Colleges might produce education as a type of good, while manors
        owned by monasteries or temples might prosper by trading with
        spirits or training priests.
      - Each manor is often associated with several surrounding
        villages; those villages supplement the Manor’s food production.
      - Typically have a population of two thousand or so, although this
        can vary widely. Humans and Gnolls are common in manors; drakes
        are also common in the Dragonshire.

  - Cities as such are rare, but they are more common (and stable) in
    the Commonwealth than elsewhere.
    
      - Though many cities may be surrounded by associated fields, they
        will not be (even almost) self-sufficient in terms of food
        production.
      - Cities are major trade-hubs, and are often founded on major
        trade routes—rivers or major overland routes.
      - Cities are peopled by traders, nobles, bureaucrats, priests and
        scholars—and the lower-class helpers they employ.
      - Cities will be supported by nearby manors; trade goods and food
        will flow from manors into cities, whose merchants will pass
        them on.
      - Common cities will have populations around fifteen thousand,
        though this number also varies quite widely; cities at the
        headlands of major rivers, surrounded by prosperous farm-land,
        can be significantly larger.
      - Though humans predominate in Commonwealth cities, they are
        highly diverse, and populations of many other races are common.
        Notably, Kobolds take well to urban living, and their numbers
        have been soaring over the last 200 years.

  - Major Cities
    
      - Province capitols, city-states and major port cities are *major
        cities*.
      - Major cities have populations over fifity-thousand—sometimes,
        albeit rarely, over one hundred thousand.
      - Major Cities have populations like those of cities, but are even
        larger and more prosperous; they are often the seat of province
        governments, and house the thrones of monarchs.

  - The Commonwealth includes a number of tribal societies.
    
      - Though many of them have built settlements, these tribes and
        peoples do not usually practice settled agriculture on a scale
        sufficient to support their societies.
      - Frequently, their able-bodied adult population ranges through
        nearby lands, hunting and foraging.
      - Some will practice shepherding; those wandering will herd
        flocks.
      - The very old, the very young, priests and artisans will live in
        their settlements, supported by smaller-scale agriculture.
      - Unlike cities, manors and villages, the borders of tribal
        territories will frequently be poorly-defined; they will be
        surrounded by great tracts of wilderness, left unspoiled by the
        other Commonwealth societies.
      - Though many tribal societies have signed the Commonwealth
        charter, and thus their members are properly Commonwealth
        citizens, they are frequently fairly isolated; they usually do
        not produce excesses of food or goods for trade, and therefore
        do not attract traders or travelers. Most simply continue to
        live as they have always lived.
      - Notably, not all tribal societies within the Commonwealth’s
        borders are members of the Commonwealth; Orks, in particular,
        have never been peacefully incorporated. These societies are
        often isolated; Commonwealth forts will ring their territory,
        Commonwealth soldiers will patrol their borders, and though they
        are left free, they will be trapped within their territories.

  - Trading Caravans
    
      - A way of life common to Halflings, Trade Caravans were vital to
        tying the early Commonwealth together; as conduits of trade,
        they were major vehicles of its prosperity.
      - Somewhat similar to tribal communities, halfling commuities are
        *dimorphic*: the able-bodied journey with the caravans, while
        the young, old and infirm live in settlements similar to small
        manors.
      - Halfling communities typically rely on villages and manors of
        other races to provide them with food; they are more likely to
        profit from trade or artisanry.

  - Underground Societies
    
      - Several commonwealth races—notably Kobolds and Ash Elves—prefer
        to live underground.
      - Subterranean cultures typically live in larger cities: tunneling
        through rock is more labor-intensive than clearing open land,
        and farming underground is impractical, so there is little
        incentive to scatter into countless villages.
      - Unsurprisingly, mining is often a primary economic activity for
        subterranean cultures.
      - They also often support large populations of artisans.
      - They support themselves by trading ore and finished goods with
        surface-dwelling peoples.

  - I was fairly drunk towards the end of this, so I need to go back and
    look this over.



      - Kethanel is a city-state located on the island Kethel in the
        gulf that separates the Orcs and Dwarves.
      - Before either the Dwarves or Orcs joined the Commonwealth,
        Kethel was settled equally by six Orcish and six Dwarven clans;
        the two shared the resources of the island—such as they were—and
        coexisted (mostly) peacefully.
      - More than 600 years ago, the Clans of Kethel met in council;
        they agreed, first, that their clan council could make decisions
        for the island as a whole, and second, that Kethel should join
        the Commonwealth, as many other Dwarven and Orcish territories
        had done.
      - Even though Kethel is more than 100 miles across, it is listed
        as a city-state, and is represented by its one major city.
        Kethanel is a city of more than thirty-five thousand situated in
        a wide bay on the continent’s Southern edge.
      - The architecture of Kethanel is striking; the city is built both
        above and below ground, and is built of massive stones carved
        and set by both Orcish and Dwarven hands. It is, not
        coincidentally, a veritable fortress.
      - Kethanel has long been a local trading and fishing hub, its role
        in trade is growing; though it has long been a port for boats
        crossing the gulf, as the Commonwealth’s sea-faring abilities
        improve, boats sailing up and around the coast from the Haven
        Isles have begun to make Kethanel a stopping-point. Some have
        whispered that a Cairn may be built in Kethanel.
      - Though Kethel is still predominantly settled by equal numbers of
        Dwarves and Orcs, after the island joined the Commonwealth it
        saw an influx of more than a thousand Gnolls, mostly of a
        unique, arctic ethnic-group; they settled in the Southeastern
        reaches of the island. More recently, Kethanel City has seen
        substantial Kobold immigration, and a small population of Ash
        Elven merchants have been carried to the city from the Haven
        Isles by boat.

### Partial Plate (Original)

Consisting of steel plates and leather straps, partial plate protects
only parts of the wearer. The typical layout will cover the throat,
shoulders, arms and shins in plate, though other arrangements exist,
including single plates directly over the heart and kidneys, or
gladiator sleeves.

Armor Value: 5 AV

Drawbacks: Cannot be worn with Full Plate.

Tags: Exposed, Layerable, Proud

Exposed makes sense but is (probably) awkward to manage at the table; 5
AV is way too much to be Layerable without penalty.

The Guards are organized into *marches*, a term borrowed from the military terminology of the Dragonshire and Kingdoms of Men; most marches correspond to a particular region of a province, although some marches with special missions might overlap others or cross provincial borders.
Each Guard is headed by a March Commander; beneath each March Commander are several Fortress Commanders, who typically oversee a primary fortification, several overland road routes, and minor outposts; and each Fortress Commander is served by Patrol Commanders responsible for a particular patrol route or unit of Guards.

March Commanders are typically responsible to the governments of the provinces in which they operate; because different provinces can have very different legal and governmental systems, the Guard can operate very differently in different provinces.
Heartland Province, for example, has no significant provincial government; their Provincial Charter endows the Guard with the ability to prosecute various forms of violent crime, and specifies that they are responsible to the city-states within whose holdings they operate.
The Dragonshire, however, has an existing civil structure, headed by Drake nobles and citizen's councils; in the Dragonshire Province, Guard units largely supplement these forces.





As characters operate in the world (and especially as they complete adventures), they will gain Rez Points (RP).
RP is usually awarded at the end of an *adventure*, and RP rewards are the primary method by which characters advance.
Characters can spend RP to advance during down-time, using the same rules by which they spent CP during character creation, with two exceptions.

First, when spending RP, the character-creation limits no longer apply, but the global limits still do.
For example, when spending RP during down-time, characters can buy more than 50 ranks in a skill (the character-creation limit), but not more than 70 (the global limit).

Second, the ways that characters advance needs to make sense.
We don't have hard-and-fast rules for this, and is generally left up to the GM.
This usually means that, in order to advance a skill, that skill should either have been used extensively in the previous adventure, or the character should spend time practicing it during down-time.
It also means that some traits cannot be acquired during down-time, like *Congenital Defect* or *Illiterate*.
(Of course, what "makes sense" is subjective, and special cases and unusual situations are always possible.)

Second, there are some traits that it would not make sense to acquire during down-time, like *Congenital Defect* and *Illiterate*.
(Of course, GMs may always choose to make exceptions.)

We don't have specific *training requirements* for acquiring skills, traits, and other features when spending RP.
In general, players and GMs should ensure that the ways that characters are advancing make sense.
For example, in order to advance a skill, a player should probably either have used it extensively in the previous adventure, or devote some time to practicing it during down-time.

The requirement that character advancement "makes sense" also precludes acquiring certain traits with RP, like "Congenital Defect* or *Illiterate* — although what "makes sense" and what does not is subjective, and unusual situations are always possible.

  - For Free:
    
      - 3 dots in your native language (pick an appropriate one)
      - 1 dot in Commonwealth Standard
      - 1 Luck
      - up to 2 Milestones

  - Pick your **Race**
    - Races provide:
      - Aptitude Bonuses
      - Durability (DUR), Strength (STR) and Size
      - Senses and movement modes
      - other special properties
    - Races are listed in *Races*.
  - Choose your **Aptitudes**
    - Each of your aptitudes begins with a rating of 15.
    - First, add your racial Aptitude modifiers.
    - Then, distribute +20 points between your various aptitudes.
      - You could add 5 to SOM, 10 to WIL and 5 to COO, for example.
    - Then, distribute -5 points between your various aptitudes.
      - You could subtract 5 from your COO, for example.
      - You can subtract points from one of the aptitudes that you added points to.
  - Pick your **Background**
    - The bonuses granted by your Background “apply” now.
      In particular, if your background grants you ranks in a skill, then you will have those skill ranks *before* you spend CP (see below).
    - Skill Ranks granted by your background work exactly like ranks that you paid for.
    - So, if your background gives you 10 ranks in Barter, you can buy 20 more ranks for 20 CP (1 a piece), and then 20 more ranks for 40 CP (2 CP a piece), and be at the maximum of 50 ranks during Character Creation.
  - Spend your **creation points (CP)**
    - Player-characters get 800 CP
    - Pick a wealth level; see the table.
    - Skill Points:
          - 1 CP → 1 point in a skill (30 or fewer skill points
            purchased)
          - 2 CP → 1 skill point (31<sup>st</sup> skill point and
            there-after)
          - Proficiency Skills: you get some proficiencies for free as
            you purchase ranks. You get your first proficiency when you
            purchase your 10<sup>th</sup> rank, and another proficiency
            every 20 ranks thereafter. (So, at your 50<sup>th</sup>
            rank, you’ll get your third free proficiency, for example.)

              - So you get a free proficiency at each of the following ranks:
              - 10 / 30 / 50 / 70
              - (But note that you can't leave character creation with more than 50 ranks in a skill, see below.)

          - 5 CP → an additional proficiency
    
      - 5 CP → A specialization
        
          - you must have 10 ranks in a skill to purchase a
            specialization for it, see *Skills*
    
      - 10 CP → a trait
    
      - 10 CP → a class
    
      - 10 CP → a power
    
      - 15 CP → +1 Luck
    
      - Items:
        
          - 1 CP → minor-cost item
          - 5 CP → moderate-cost item
          - 10 CP → major-cost item
          - 20 CP → extreme-cost item
          - We don’t track the CP cost of Trivial-cost items; most
            useful trivial-cost items are best acquired as parts of
            skill kits.
          - see *Items*
    
      - 5 CP → a dot in a language

  - Motivations
    
      - pick your motivations now (see *Motivations*)

  - Character Creation Limits
    
      - no more than 50 ranks in a skill
      - no aptitudes higher than 35 or lower than 5
      - at least 100 CP spent on skills with the *combat* tag
      - at least 100 CP spent on skills with the *knowledge* tag
      - ~~at least 200 CP spent on skills that don't have the *combat* tag~~
